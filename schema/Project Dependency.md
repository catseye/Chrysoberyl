Project Dependency (schema)
===========================

This is a schema which defines, for now, a few rudimentary things about
what properties Project Dependency entries in Chrysoberyl should have.

The order in which they are listed here induces an order in which they
should appear on each entry.

### specification-link

The URL of a site that defines what the dependency is.  Sometimes this is
a spec (specification document).  Sometimes it is a standards body.
Sometimes it is just the most informative tutorial we could find.
Sometimes it is just the Github project that implements the standard the
best.  The point is, we try.

### suggested-implementation

*   optional: true

suggested-implementation.
