Chrysoberyl
===========

*Chrysoberyl* is an attempt to catalogue, and curate, the things produced
by, and related to, Cat's Eye Technologies.

It is something between a wiki and a database and a semantic web and
_The Devil's Dictionary_.

It is supposed to be primarily informative, and only secondarily machine-
processable, and only thirdly structured.  For this purpose, it has
historically been collected in relatively ad-hoc YAML files, but in 2017
it was converted to [Feedmark][] format, which is a subset of Markdown.

These Feedmark articles can be found in [the article directory](article/).

Chrysoberyl contains primarily things produced by Cat's Eye Technologies;
it only contains things not produced by Cat's Eye Technologies when they
directly relate to things that are (e.g. Perl 5.12 might have an entry,
but only as a "Project Dependency", not as a "Programming Language".)

This README used to contain a lot more information, but a lot of it has
gone out of date at this point, but if you're interested, you can look
it up in this repository's history.
