Chrysoberyl
===========

*Chrysoberyl* is an attempt to catalogue, and curate, the things produced
by, and related to, Cat's Eye Technologies.

It is something between a wiki and a database and a semantic web and a
pile of goo.

It is supposed to be primarily informative, and only secondarily machine-
processable, and only thirdly structured.  So, the schemas in use are
fuzzy, flexible, incomplete, and subject to change and the drop of a hat.

It does not contain only those things produced by Cat's Eye Technologies;
in theory, anything can be in it.  In these cases, the entry may consist
simply of commentary on the item.
