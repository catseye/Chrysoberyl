Here are some games developed by Cat's Eye Technologies.  A game is anything you can play, but
most of these are meant to be played on a computer.  Some can even be played online here, in your web browser.

Note that the distinctions between a Game and a Gewgaw or even an Automaton are not always clear,
and entries here may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.

_Bubble Escape_ is a video game written for the [Commodore 64][] where the
player must guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  It was originally
designed and implemented in [Commodore BASIC 2.0][] in the mid-80's, and
rewritten in [Ophis Assembler][] in the late 00's.
The assembly version was pared down so that (crunched) it fit into 2K,
christened "Bubble Escape 2K", and submitted to the [Mini Game Compo 2009][]
where it won first place in its class.

*   online @ [catseye.tc](http://catseye.tc/installation/The_New_Gamerly_Realism)

Only when the conscious habit of coding culture's little interactions,
Marios and Lara Crofts in games disappears
_will we witness a purely gamerly work of gamedev_.

I have transformed myself _in the zero of gameplay_ and have fished myself out
of the _rubbishy slough of mainstream gaming_...

Only dull and impotent gamedevs veil their work with _sincerity_.
Gaming requires _truth_, not _sincerity_.

_Levels have vanished like smoke; to attain the new gamerly paradigm_,
gamedev advances towards creation as an end in itself and towards
reification of the interactions of culture.

### Animals

*   genre: Guessing
*   authors: Unknown
*   auspices: Unknown

_Animals_ is a classic "expert system" game.  The computer asks you to think of an
animal, and then asks you a series of yes/no questions in an attempt to
discover what animal you chose.  If it comes to the wrong conclusion, it
asks you for a question that would distinguish the animal that you chose,
and adds it to its database.  In this way it "learns" about more animals
as more games are played.

#### Implementation: animals.erl

*   in-distribution: [Animals distribution](http://catseye.tc/distribution/Animals_distribution)
*   license: Public Domain
*   inception-date: ca 1999
*   host-language: Erlang
*   interface: terminal

### Flip

*   genre: Guessing
*   inception-date: 1977
*   authors: John S. James
*   auspices: Unknown
*   specification-link: [www.atariarchives.org](http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/showpage.php?page=61)

_Flip_ is a very simple computer game by John S. James which first appeared
in the March/April 1977 edition of _Creative Computing_.
In the game, the computer flips a virtual coin 50 times, and the object is
for you to guess whether the coin will come up heads or tails each time.
What makes it interesting is that the coin is not fair.  The computer tries
to find patterns in your guesses, and exploit them by biasing the coin toss
away from what it thinks you are likely to guess next.

#### Implementation: flip.erl

*   in-distribution: [Flip distribution](http://catseye.tc/distribution/Flip_distribution)
*   license: Public Domain
*   inception-date: Jul 31 2002

### Hunt the Wumpus

*   specification-link: [www.atariarchives.org](http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/showpage.php?page=178)

_Hunt the Wumpus_ is a classic topological mythical-beast-hunting game
from the era of teletypes.  Gregory Yob was disappointed by the
number of games based on "find an objective hidden on a
2-dimensional grid", and decided to design one that was based on
a world less orthogonal.

#### Implementation: wumpus.erl

*   in-distribution: [wumpus.erl distribution](http://catseye.tc/distribution/wumpus.erl_distribution)
*   license: BSD license
