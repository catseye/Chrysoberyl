Here are some games developed by Cat's Eye Technologies.  A game is anything you can play, but
most of these are meant to be played on a computer.  Some can even be played online here, in your web browser.

Note that the distinctions between a Game and a [Gewgaw](Gewgaws.md) or even an
[Automaton](Automata.md) are not always clear,
and entries here may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.

where it won first place in its class.

Only when the conscious habit of coding culture's little interactions,
Marios and Lara Crofts in games disappears
_will we witness a purely gamerly work of gamedev_.

I have transformed myself _in the zero of gameplay_ and have fished myself out
of the _rubbishy slough of mainstream gaming_...

Only dull and impotent gamedevs veil their work with _sincerity_.
Gaming requires _truth_, not _sincerity_.

_Levels have vanished like smoke; to attain the new gamerly paradigm_,
gamedev advances towards creation as an end in itself and towards
reification of the interactions of culture.
