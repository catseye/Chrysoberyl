Texts. But isn't everything in Chrysoberyl a text
of some sort?  Yes, but those are texts *about* something.
These are texts that stand as works on their own.

Note that concrete poetry and the like may be
categorized under Texts, or Pictures, or both.

*   inception-date: Nov 2013
*   submitted-to: NaNoGenMo 2013 (completed)
*   online @ [catseye.tc](http://catseye.tc/view/NaNoGenLab/generated/Nif.md)
*   file @ [catseye.tc](http://catseye.tc/modules/NaNoGenLab/generated/Nif.md)

*Nif* is a novel generated for NaNoGenMo 2013.  It is about a petulant child
(possibly named Nif) who has just discovered palindromes.  It is one long palindrome.

*Nif* was inspired by, and draws heavily from, Nick Montfort's
"The Utterance of the Petulant Child." In fact, it is pretty much an homage to
"Utterance" which attempts to turn the petulance dial up to eleven, so to speak.
Its creation was also sparked by a dim memory of the life ambition of one of
the characters on the terrible 80's sitcom Head of the Class, which was:
to write a novel that was one long palindrome.
