others of these are MP4's.

### Uri Geller Psychokinesing an Ashtray

This movie is based on a model I did back around 2007, based on an idea I had much
earlier (sometime in the 1990's) for how to model a glass ashtray in POVRay.

It only became clear that it was, in fact, footage of a demonstration of
psychokinesis by Uri Geller (not shown) after it was declassified by the
CIA (and reclassified as fake news) in 2017.
