Retrocomputing
==============

Stuff done at Cat's Eye Technologies on older computers, or more
often, an emulation of such a computer on a modern computer instead.

### Apple II

**[Apple Befunge][]** is an implementation of Befunge for the Apple II.

### Commodore VIC-20

**[Dungeons of Ekileugor][]** is a roguelike.

### Commodore 64

### Amiga 500

*   wikipedia: [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500)

A home computer of old.  You may have heard of it?

The CPU was a Motorola 68000, but this could be upgraded to a 68020, etc
(and needed to be if you wanted memory protection).  It had many custom chips
with colourful names such as "Angus" and "Paula".

[AmigaDOS 1.3](http://www.pagetable.com/docs/amigados_tripos/amigados_manual.pdf)
was the version of Amiga's operating system which was current when the Amiga 500
was a really popular home computer — mostly for video games, but also for graphics
and video processing, such as ray-tracing and animation.

AmigaBasic was the name of the "advanced" variant of BASIC that shipped with
AmigaDOS.  It was developed by Microsoft.

[E-UAE](http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/) is an emulator for the Amiga 500
architecture (and several other models such as the Amiga 2000.)  E-UAE is written
in C++ and available under the GPL.

### MS-DOS

**[Shelta][]** is a programming language.

**[ILLGOL][]** is an illness disguised as a programming language empire.

### Z80

*   genre: machine language

*   wikipedia: [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80)

**[Mildred][]** is a Z80-based homebrew computer.
