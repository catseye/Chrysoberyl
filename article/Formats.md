### Falderal

*   subtitle: **Literate Testing for Languages**
*   inception-date: 2011

Falderal is a file format for literate test suites.  It is particularly
suited for documenting programming languages (or other specifications of
ways to transform text) and testing their implementation(s) in a
language-agnostic fashion.  The dumbed-down sound-bite version:
"doctests for DSLs".  It can be embedded in both Markdown and Literate
Haskell.
