### Funicular

*   summary: Scripts to set up dev environments on various OS'es on sundry architectures
*   inception-date: Jun 17 2014
*   development-stage: not fully complete

**Funicular** is a system that semi-automates the creation of development
environments on eclectic architectures. "Semi-automate" means it automates
what it can, and provides repeatable instructions for you to follow for
what it can't.

"Eclectic architectures" is not terribly-well defined, but it includes
retrocomputing and esoteric architectures.  Basically, if you've got an
emulator for it and install and support images for it, you might be able
to install and outfit and and run a system for it, using Funicular.

It replaces [[Amiga Gondola]].  It can handle such OS/emulator combinations
as [[AmigaDOS 1.3]] under [[E-UAE]] emulating an [[Amiga 500]],
[[FreeDOS]] under [[QEMU]], and [[NetBSD]] under [[QEMU]].

### shelf

*   summary: A "package manager" that doesn't actually install anything
*   inception-date: 2016
*   development-stage: work in progress

`shelf` is a "package manager" which doesn't actually install any files.
Instead, it stores the source trees of sundry packages in a single directory,
creates link farms to the interesting files within those trees,
and manages your search paths to include those link farms.
those trees. The source trees are typically the working directories of
local git or Mercurial clones, or they can be source distributions from tarballs.
`shelf`, written in Bourne shell, is a replacement for `toolshelf`, which was
written in Python.

The LEDs display the bit pattern at the current address in memory.
Via the keyboard, the switches may be toggled, a new bit pattern
written into memory, and the address advanced. In this way, machine
code programs may be entered into memory, and then run.
SITU-PAN was written during RetroChallenge 2015/07 for the purposes
of entering [[SITU-MON]] into an emulated C64.

#### Implementation: frontpanel.bas

about its output format; just toss its output through T-Rext when you're
done to make it more presentable.

### Rooibos

*   summary: Simple, single-module parser combinator library
*   inception-date: '2011'
*   development-stage: archival

Rooibos is a parser combinator library for Python. Modelled somewhat
after yeanpypa (self-contained, public domain), but compensates for what
I considered a fatal flaw in yeanpypa (no good way to describe a
recursive grammar.) Has a fatal flaw of its own (can only parse
strictly LL(1) grammars â€” no backtracking is yet possible.) Originally
used in [Eightebed][], but provided here for ease of transplanting into
other projects.

#### Implementation: rooibos.py

### TPiS

*   subtitle: **Total Procedures in Scheme**
*   summary: Totality-checker for Scheme procedures
*   inception-date: ca 2006
*   development-stage: archival

This is a static analyzer, written in Scheme, which can check if
given Scheme procedures are total (always terminate, on any input) by
checking that they are specified primitive-recursively.  What's more, it
is written almost entirely in a primitive-recursive style, so it can
check itself!

#### Implementation: TPiS (Scheme)

*   reference: true
*   in-distribution: TPiS distribution
*   license: BSD license
*   host-language: Scheme
