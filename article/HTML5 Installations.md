*   ok-to-use-as-input-when-creating-a-refdex: false

This is a list of [games][], [platforms][], [automata][], [languages][], and [gewgaws][]
which have HTML5 installations hosted online on [Cat's Eye Technologies][]'
website, `catseye.tc`.

It contains some instructions for using each of these installations.

Note: some of the properties on the installation entries are meant to be
more machine-read than human-read, but you can just skip over those.

### Bubble Escape

*   installation-of: [Bubble Escape 2K][]
*   installed-implementation: bubble_escape_2k.prg
*   interactive: true
*   animated: true
*   mediums: [6502 machine code][], [JaC64][], [Java Web Start][], [HTML5][]
*   jnlp-link: https://catseye.tc/applets/bubble_escape_2k_webstart.jnlp
*   jar-url: https://catseye.tc/applets/jac64.jar
*   java-command: java -jar jac64.jar -a c64programs/bubble_escape_2k.prg
*   online @ [catseye.tc](https://catseye.tc/ix/Bubble_Escape)

You can play it online in the [JaC64][] emulator using Java Web Start.
Use your arrow keys to guide the bubble through the maze.  Avoid the
hazards and find the five keys to unlock the exit.

You can also download the D64 disk image file
[bubble escape.d64](https://github.com/catseye/Bubble-Escape/blob/master/disk/bubble%20escape.d64?raw=true)
and run it in VICE x64 or some other Commodore 64 emulator.

If this game doesn't seem too impressive to you, try to remember, it's
only two kilobytes of code!  These days you can't even sneeze in less
than a megabyte.

### Cosmos Boulders

#### Background

Only when the conscious habit of coding culture's little interactions,
Marios and Lara Crofts in games disappears
_will we witness a purely gamerly work of gamedev_.

I have transformed myself _in the zero of gameplay_ and have fished myself out
of the _rubbishy slough of mainstream gaming_...

Only dull and impotent gamedevs veil their work with _sincerity_.
Gaming requires _truth_, not _sincerity_.

_Levels have vanished like smoke; to attain the new gamerly paradigm_,
gamedev advances towards creation as an end in itself and towards
reification of the interactions of culture.

#### Instructions

Use the arrow keys to guide the protagonist (represented by a black square)
around the playfield (represented by a black square) to collect all the
treasures (represented by black squares) while avoiding the pits (represented
by black squares.)  Each treasure collected earns the player 10 points; the
score is shown in the upper-left (in black).  The player begins the game with
three lives; succumbing to a pit costs a life; the number of lives is
displayed in the lower-left (in black).  When the game is over, left-click
the canvas to start a new game.

Detractors and other peasants may satisfy themselves that this is actually a
game and not just an entirely black gif or something by opening a Javascript
console and typing `BACKGROUND_COLOR='green'`.

*   online @ [catseye.tc](https://catseye.tc/ix/BefOS)

This is an HTML5 installation of [BefOS][], a Befunge-themed operating
system which is neither Befunge, nor an operating system.  (Discuss.)
It runs on a web page thanks to the
[HTML5][]-based [IBM PC compatible][] emulator, [v86][].

The system is delivered on a 1.44M floppy image, which contains the
BefOS boot block, kernal, and the handful of sample pages which are
included in the default build.

If v86 doesn't work in your browser, you can
[download the disk image](https://catseye.tc/distfiles/befos-0.10.img)
and use it in an emulator such as [QEMU][] or [DOSBox][]
or, wonder of wonders, a real IBM PC compatible â€” if you can write it onto
a floppy disk somehow...

Instructions:

The percentage of balls held fixed can be changed by the slider, and
the "Restart" button can be used to scatter the balls and restart their
movements.  You can try out different values and see which one you like
the best.

Background:

The original idea was this: each ball travels on a
sine-wave path (kind of like a spring) between a randomly-chosen
pair of two other balls.

It was soon discovered that if all balls are free to move like this,
they all quickly collapse to a single point.  Thus, some number of
balls are held fixed (5% by default).  The result is a slightly
organic-seeming emergent motion.

*   online @ [catseye.tc](https://catseye.tc/ix/Pixley)

Instructions:

Select an example program from the dropdown box,
then click "Start" to run it.  Or click "Edit" to modify an example
program, or create your own program.

Background:

This is an online implementation of [Pixley][] which, as a bonus, also
depicts the Pixley program as a set of coloured, nested rectangles.

This [Javascript][] implementation of Pixley uses the *Web Workers*
facility of your browser to run the evaluation process.  So, if your
browser does not support Web Workers, it may not function correctly.

For the Pixley project, a Pixley interpreter was implemented in
Pixley itself ("meta-circularly") and in this installation,
the **Wrap in Pixley Interpreter** button will take the Pixley
program that has been loaded and put it inside this
Pixley-interpreter-in-Pixley.

Evaluating a program wrapped in a Pixley interpreter will result
in the same result as the unwrapped program.  It will just take
longer.

Evaluating a program wrapped in a Pixley interpreter
*wrapped in a Pixley interpreter* will also result
in the same result as the unwrapped program.  It will just take
*quite a bit* longer.

In theory, this "tower" of wrapped interpreters could go on forever,
and they should all produce the same result.

However, in physical reality, computers have limitations, such as
a finite amount of memory available.  In my installation of Firefox,
for example, wrapping a program in three levels of interpreters
results in a "stack overflow" error being displayed in the Javascript
console, and the evaluation process never finishing.

*   online @ [catseye.tc](https://catseye.tc/ix/Shelta)

This is [Shelta][], a language with a tiny compiler and a
self-hosted compiler, running under [FreeDOS][] running
on a web page via the [HTML5][]-based [IBM PC compatible][]
emulator, [v86][] â€”  so you can bootstrap it right in your browser.

Instructions:

The system running online on v86 is delivered on a 720K floppy image,
which contains a minimal bootable FreeDOS install, the Shelta distribution,
plus various tools such as the `TED3` text editor, and `YASM`.
License and distribution information is included on the disk image.

You can use the pre-built Shelta compiler (whose source is written in NASM)
to build the example programs, or to bootstrap the Shelta compiler
written in Shelta.  See the welcome message, shown after FreeDOS
boots, for more details.

Documentation for Shelta is also on the disk image, and can be viewed
with `TYPE` or `EDIT`, but you may find it more convenient to browse
these files online:

*   [Original Shelta README, 1999](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/readme.txt)
*   [Making the Snake Eat its Tail: Bootstrapping](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/bootstrp.txt)

*   [Shelta under FreeDOS, 2013](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/fdos2013.txt)

If v86 doesn't work in your browser, you can
[download the disk image](https://catseye.tc/distfiles/freedos-1.0-shelta-1.2-floppy-2.img)
and use it in an emulator such as [QEMU][] or [DOSBox][]
or, wonder of wonders, a real IBM PC compatible â€” if you can write it onto
a floppy disk somehow...

*   online @ [catseye.tc](https://catseye.tc/ix/Whothm)

[Whothm][] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.
This installation contains a Java application which implements Whothm, and lets you
interactively try out Whothm programs online, using Java Web Start. The implementation
is only an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of
hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is left up to your imagination.

Instructions:

Whothm is a simple language for describing infinite shapes. It is
described fully in the documentation in the [Whothm][] distribution.

Click "Run" or press Alt+R to run the program.  The result is displayed in
the canvas on the right.  Page Up and Page Down can be used to zoom in and
out of the canvas.

Syntax errors often result in an error message in the status bar,
but might not in all cases.  In these cases, consulting your browser's
Java console, if it has one, might elucidate the cause of the error.
Or it might not.

Obviously, this implementation does not support generating or
displaying the entire infinite drawing.  In fact, it only runs the loop
for a couple of hundred iterations.  The full shape is left up to your
imagination.

Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
black moves right.

Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
stops at a distance *a* - *a* Ã— 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
cards.

To begin exploring, we suggest you first try different presets
from the *Presets* drop-down in the control panel on the right.

You can also paste the URL of an image in the *Image URL* text box,
and click "Load", to try a different image.

If you want to get your hands dirty, you can open the *Adjustments*
panel, in which you will find various sliders with which you can
control all the parameters.

#### How can I save an image?

In Firefox, you can right-click on the canvas and select "View image",
and save that.  In other browsers, the easiest way may be to click the
_Pause_ button and take a screenshot.
(You can thank the security model used in the HTML5 canvas for this.)

#### The animation isn't perfectly smooth.

This is an unavoidable consequence of conventional operating systems â€”
your web browser isn't the only thing that's running, and may not get a
chance to run until it's too late to display the next animation frame.

In other HTML animations, this can be worked around â€” the animation still
drops frames, but intermediate steps can be computed so that it doesn't
look excessively jerky.  However, that may not be a realistic option here,
due to how the feedback process works.

You can minimize frame-dropping by:

*   choosing a relatively small image
*   finding a sufficiently powerful computer (with sufficiently powerful
    video hardware, especially) to run it on
*   making sure you have no other programs running, and no other tabs
    open in your browser
*   letting your browser "warm up" a bit after closing other tabs etc.,
    so that it doesn't have anything pending to clean up after
*   **not** moving the mouse pointer.

#### Now my desktop is twisting counter-clockwise!

You've just been staring at it too long.

#### Wait, I see _five-fold symmetry_.  Where is that coming from?

To be honest, I really don't know.

#### Background

The idea came about while discussing [Nam June Paik][], and video art in
general, with Gareth Jackson.

It was noted by one of us that, before digital video technology, there were
a number of analogue effects that were employed in video art that aren't
seen as frequently these days.  A notable one was the use of _feedback_, the
simplest version being training a camera on a monitor that is displaying
the feed from that same camera.  More sophisticated applications are
of course possible; a relatively famous example is the 1970's version of
the Doctor Who title sequence.

The question arose: could something analogous could be done with digital
video, and if so, how?

And I came up with this as a simple technique which is similar to video
feedback and which can be implemented straightforwardly in an HTML5
canvas element.

The default image used when Canvas Feedback starts up was designed by
Gareth Jackson specifically to be a pleasing subject for this feedback
process.

It's turtle graphics, except there's a small
margin of error.  You might ask for "Turn right 90 degrees"
but you might get only "Turn right 89.91 degrees".

It uses a faint pen, so if you repeat the drawing instructions
many times over, you get a nice pencilly noisy effect.

There is support for a rudimentary command language similar to
Logo, for user-created designs.  The commands are:

    fd NUM             move forward this many pixels
    rt NUM             rotate right this many degrees
    lt NUM             rotate left this many degrees
    setxyr NUM NUM     set the coordinates, as a percentage of the
                       width and height of the canvas
    shiftxyr NUM NUM   adjust the coordinates, as a percentage of the
                       width and height of the canvas
    seterr NUM NUM     set the error rate for rotations and
                       movements respectively
    shifterr NUM NUM   adjust the error rate for rotations and
                       movements respectively

The semicircles alternate being on the left and the right.  The first
two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are `1, 1` and these make up the unit
circle in the center of the spiral.

The animation is simply a zooming out and back in on the spiral.

*Warning: the following may contain tedious and/or glib
background and/or analysis.*

Casting a negative space of knowledge.  Calling itself a "plate" frames
it as a work of learning, like some kind of 19th-century anthropology text.
Yet it only raises questions â€” what are these entities?  what kind of
world do they inhabit?  what are they protecting?  who is Clarkson?
â€” without providing answers, leaving it up to the observer to either
imagine their own answers, or decide that answers to these questions
are not necessary.

The segment length can be changed while a curve is being drawn.
Changing the draw mode will reset the drawing.
Changing the start or end of a curve while it is being drawn
might result in glitching in XOR mode (depending on your browser's
implementation of the HTML5 canvas -- I don't really know why this
happens.)

Most recursive fractals are created top-down: start with a big thing, add some smaller things to it,
add some even smaller things to those things, etc.

I was curious about what it would be like if a fractal was generated bottom-up: start with many small
things, connect them to larger things, then connect those to even larger things, etc.

This is the result of implementing that method.

Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
{cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
be selected by the slider.

Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)
