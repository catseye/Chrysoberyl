Demos

Not sure what to do with these two.

### Ribos

*   reference distribution: [C64 Demo Depot](/distribution/C64 Demo Depot)
*   inception date: Apr 2007

A simple Commodore 64 graphics demo that uses the raster interrupt facility
of the VIC-II chip: the colour of the border of the screen is inverted,
but only in the middle part of the screen.  Includes well-commented source
in 6502 assembly language.

### The PETulant Cursor

*   reference distribution: [C64 Demo Depot](/distribution/C64 Demo Depot)
*   inception date: ca 1989

A tiny (44 byte) "display hack" for the Commodore 64.
