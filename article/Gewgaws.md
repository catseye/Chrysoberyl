In [Chrysoberyl][] parlance, a _gewgaw_ is the digital version of a
bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.

A gewgaw need not be implemented in [HTML5][], but many of
[Cat's Eye Technologies][]' gewgaws are, and you can can experience
them here, online, right in your web browser.

Note that the distinctions between a Gewgaw and an [Automaton](Automata.md)
or even a [Game](Games.md) are not always clear, and entries here may be
categorized somewhat arbitrarily, and you might want to check those articles
too.

### Heronsis hermnonicii

![preview](http://static.catseye.tc/images/screenshots/Heronsis_hermnonicii.jpg)

*   inception date: 2013
*   reference distribution: [HTML5 Gewgaws distribution](http://catseye.tc/distribution/HTML5_Gewgaws_distribution)
*   reference implementation name: heronsis-hermnonicii.js
*   online @ [catseye.tc](http://catseye.tc/installation/Heronsis_hermnonicii)

An animated "plate" depicting a proto-cohort of *Heronsis hermnonicii*.

*Warning: the following may contain tedious and/or glib
background and/or analysis.*

Casting a negative space of knowledge.  Calling itself a "plate" frames
it as a work of learning, like some kind of 19th-century anthropology text.
Yet it only raises questions — what are these entities?  what kind of
world do they inhabit?  what are they protecting?  who is Clarkson?
— without providing answers, leaving it up to the observer to either
imagine their own answers, or decide that answers to these questions
are not necessary.

Plus it's fun to click on the red balls.

*   inception date: May 2016
*   reference distribution: [HTML5 Gewgaws distribution](http://catseye.tc/distribution/HTML5_Gewgaws_distribution)

Most recursive fractals are created top-down: start with a big thing, add some smaller things to it,
add some even smaller things to those things, etc.

I was curious about what it would be like if a fractal was generated bottom-up: start with many small
things, connect them to larger things, then connect those to even larger things, etc.

This is the result of implementing that method.

### Progression

Animated op-art exhibiting a [moiré](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) effect.

A real eye-tickler.  This was one of the first bits of `<canvas>` code I
ever wrote; I essentially wrote it by accident — it wasn't quite what I
meant, but I liked it, and kept it.  For me, in Firefox, it starts getting
interesting around 100 iterations, and starts stopping being interesting
around 1550.  In Chromium, you can still see some activity at about 2000
iterations, but it's very faint thereafter.

An attempt as making generative asemic writing (well, printing) that was going
alright and then I started to go a little overboard and then it no longer looks
much like writing.  There was another idea here that remains unexplored, namely,
constructing a Markov model in one context (say, words of a text) and extracting
it and using it in an unrelated context (say, when building a spadget.)
