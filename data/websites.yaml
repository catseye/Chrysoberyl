    `catseye.tc` is [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' website:
    [http://catseye.tc/](http://catseye.tc/).
    
    It was, until recently, the official distribution channel of Cat's Eye
    Technologies' public offerings â€” mostly software distributions, but also
    some [[Electronics Project|electronics projects]], unsolicited opinions,
    and other miscellany.  It continues to be the canonical mouthpiece
    and reference work of Cat's Eye Technologies.  However, many of its
    software services, such source repositories and issue tracking, are now
    handled offsite, at Cat's Eye Technologies' accounts on 
    [Github](https://github.com/catseye/) and
    [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/catseye/).
    
    In years past, the Cat's Eye Technologies web site was hosted on
    various different domains.  From most recently to least recently, they
    have been:
    
    *   `catseye.tc`
    *   `catseye.webhop.net`
    *   `catseye.mine.nu:8080`
    *   `www.catseye.mb.ca`
    *   `www.cats-eye.com`
    *   and way back in the mists of time, `www.pangea.ca/cet/`.
    
    This frequent relocation of our web address was done specifically to
    please [[Phantom Hoover]].  (We're working on a [[brainfuck]] derivative,
    too, to make his joy complete.  Stay tuned.)
    
    `catseye.tc` may be considered our permanent domain name -- we're stuck
    with it now that it's part of the [[Java]] namespaces of our products,
    right?  Feel free to make links to this site using URLs that begin with
    `http://catseye.tc/`. The `www` prefix is not required.
    
    Our aim in making this website is that it both conforms to W3C
    standards and provides a reasonable user experience.
    Well, that used to be our aim, then [[HTML5]] came along.
    
    The site content is generated from a database called [[Chrysoberyl]]
    which consists of Markdown documents and other structured data embedded
    in Yaml files.
    
    It is rendered with Jinja2 templates to produce HTML files.
    We do use [[Javascript]] on the pages on this site, but we try to do
    so judiciously when it's not fully required, such as in an
    [[Online Installation]].
