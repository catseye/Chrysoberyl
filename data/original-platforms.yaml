    This is a project I began in the late 90's, to write an "operating system"
    in the theme of [[Befunge-93]].  It never got very far, but it does boot and do some
    cute things, so I have modernized it (from Turbo Assembler to NASM) and
    made it available here.

  description: |
    `yoob` is a framework for implementing esoteric programming languages
    in Java.  It aims to make it easy for a user to experiment with a large
    number of esolangs with a minimal install burden (i.e. in a Java applet),
    and to make it easy for designers to rapidly implement and showcase
    their esolangs.
