  subtitle: An Operating System for the Linearly Challenged
  summary: Befunge-themed miniature operating system
  description: |
    This is a project I began in the late 90's, to write an "operating system"
    in the theme of Befunge.  It never got very far, but it does boot and do some
    cute things, so I have modernized it (from Turbo Assembler to NASM) and
    made it available here.

  type: Platform
  summary: A framework for interactive esolang implementation
  description: |
    `yoob` is a framework for implementing esoteric programming languages
    in Java.  It aims to make it easy for a user to experiment with a large
    number of esolangs with a minimal install burden (i.e. in a Java applet),
    and to make it easy for designers to rapidly implement and showcase
    their esolangs.
