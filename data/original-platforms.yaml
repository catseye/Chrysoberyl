BefOS: 
  type: Platform
  subtitle: An Operating System for the Linearly Challenged
  description: |
    BefOS is a program which boots off of a floppy disk, and is
    billed as a Befunge-themed toy operating system for the
    [[IBM PC compatible]] architecture.  However, it omits
    most of the functionality of an operating system, and most of the
    functionality of Befunge as well, and therefore might be more
    accurately described as a disk sector editor with some unusual
    features.

  description: |
    `yoob` is a framework for implementing esoteric programming languages
    in Java.  It aims to make it easy for a user to experiment with a large
    number of esolangs with a minimal install burden (i.e. in a Java applet),
    and to make it easy for designers to rapidly implement and showcase
    their esolangs.
