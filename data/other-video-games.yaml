    Quite possibly the cutest game ever.
    
    Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author, Dan Gorlin, pointed out in
    [his interview for Halcyon Days](http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/GORLIN.HTM):
    
    > I like it because it's unique, the gameplay is simple but infinitely

    > mistook it for a shooter at the time, but it's really more like a game
    > of Blitzkrieg Chess. If you just start blasting you lose immediately.

    To the untrained eye, it's a ripoff of Pac-Man: fill in all the regions
    instead of eat all the dots.  But there's something about it that sets it
    apart — maybe it's that the action is more frenetic and somehow
    smoother (if slightly buggier,) maybe it's because the
    strategy is different (more emphasis on getting the power-ups just to
    stay alive.)

    A jumping minivan?  Yes, a jumping minivan.  And European police.
    And a devil-cat-thing with a checkered flag.  And a balloon that warps
    you to other cities.  How can you not love it?
    
    Not sure if it's truly a platformer, though.

    An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional 
    maze game where the fourth dimension is *scale*.  Rolling things
    up is also surprisingly satisfying and disturbingly addictive.  To top it all off,
    the soundtrack can't be beat.

    Very cute.  Quite possibly a sequel or pseudo-sequel to
    [[The New Zealand Story]], since you play what appears to be a platypus,
    and there are oblique references to TNZS (in one of the secret chambers,
    the platforms are arranged in the shape of the kiwi.)

    Gnarly game, but very hard.  I especially liked the 3D effect on the
    intermediate levels with the staircases.  (Even though it's awkward to
    control and far too easy to die on these.)  The "word from our
    sponsor" interruptions are also quite cute.
    
    There is something coherent and unified about the design of
    this game that you don't often see in other games; you get the impression
    that it was *crafted* rather than simply produced.
    
    Well, maybe I'm overstating it a bit, but you get the idea.

    "This game is dedicated to all maze fans."  However, that should not deter
    fans of kiwis, archery, flying machines shaped like bears' heads,
    laser pistols, magical fireball-belching staffs, and the like.

    The only sports game on my list, but that's probably because it doesn't
    really feel anything like sport.  It's only barely realistic — for example,
    there is clearly no limit to the amount of spin you can impart to
    your jump.  The longer you keep holding X and right, the more rotational
    velocity you'll have when you catch air.  Whee!  And it has another
    soundtrack that can't be beat, too.

    I didn't think I'd like this one, since I really don't like those wooden mazes
    that you tilt with the two dials — which is essentially what this game
    is.  But somehow it manages to be fun.  Especially when you start barrelling
    down a spiral, completely out of control.  The party games I could mostly
    do without, with the exception of racing, which is at least as fun as the main game.

    There's something that's always attracted me about being able
    to shoot out bits of wall.  The boxes and conveyor belts hold a similar
    draw.  Not sure if I can put my finger on exactly what it is, though.

    To this day, this stands as the best video game that EA ever released.
    (I can't say best game in toto, because that might be better reserved for
    [[Adventure Construction Set]].)  Sure, it was something of a ripoff of Jumpman.  But it added so
    many elements, played really well, and best of all, had a level editor.
    I'm a sucker for a level editor.

Llamatron:

    Fast-paced, psychedaelic, mindless fun, like most Jeff Minter games.
    Basically a clone of the arcade game Robotron, but with shaggy, smelly
    quadrupeds.  And cans of Coke.  And Mandelbrot sets...

    A retrogame I recently discovered where two players, starting at the top
    of some multi-floored structure, race to fall down to each next lowest
    level; the first to fall through a floor captures it, and the player who
    captures the most floors wins.  Strangely addictive in spite of (or
    possibly because of) its simplicity; there is a large element of luck,
    since you don't know where the holes are going to be in upcoming
    floors, but also an element of strategy, since the floors are low-friction
    and you carry momentum, and a lot of just frantic fun running-around
    action.
