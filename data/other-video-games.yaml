    Quite possibly the cutest game ever.
    
    Not actually a shoot-'em-up, as the author pointed out in that one
    interview which I'll have to link in here at some point.
    
    Was also released for the Atari ST, but I never played it there.

    To the untrained eye, it's a ripoff of Pac-Man: fill in all the regions
    instead of eat all the dots.  But there's something about it that sets it
    apart — maybe it's that the action is more frenetic and somehow
    smoother (if slightly buggier,) maybe it's because the
    strategy is different (more emphasis on getting the power-ups just to
    stay alive.)

    A jumping minivan?  Yes, a jumping minivan.  And European police.
    And a devil-cat-thing with a checkered flag.  And a balloon that warps
    you to other cities.  How can you not love it?
    
    Not sure if it's truly a platformer, though.

    An extremely original game — sort of a four-dimensional 
    maze game where the fourth dimension is *scale*.  Rolling things
    up is also surprisingly satisfying and disturbingly addictive.  To top it all off,
    the soundtrack can't be beat.

    Very cute.  Quite possibly a sequel or pseudo-sequel to The New Zealand
    Story, since you play what appears to be a platypus, and there are oblique
    references to TNZS (in one of the secret chambers, the platforms are arranged
    in the shape of the kiwi.)
