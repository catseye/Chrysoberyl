'A Non-Random Walk':

  summary: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.

    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* Ã— 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

    Regardless, the original idea was this: each ball travels on a
    sine-wave path (kind of like a spring) between a randomly-chosen
    pair of two other balls.
    
    It was soon discovered that if all balls are free to move like this,
    they all quickly collapse to a single point.  Thus, some number of
    balls are held fixed (5% by default).  The result is a slightly
    organic-seeming emergent motion.
  instructions: |    
    The percentage of balls held fixed can be changed by the slider, and
    the "Restart" button can be used to scatter the balls and restart their
    movements.  You can try out different values and see which one you like
    the best.

    A spiral made up of semicircles with proportions in the Fibonacci sequence.
    The semicircles alternate being on the left and the right.  The first
    two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are `1, 1` and these make up the unit
    circle in the center of the spiral.
    
    The animation is simply a zooming out and back in on the spiral.

    The animation will eventually cycle if you're patient (although it won't

    the "terminal" option to prevent this cycling.

    Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
    {cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
    colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
    of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
    be selected by the slider.
    
    Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
    You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
    several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
    of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)
