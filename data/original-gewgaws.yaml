'Canvas Feedback':
  type: Gewgaw
  development-stage: work in progress
  defining-distribution: HTML5 Gewgaws distribution
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  inception-date: 2013
  description: |
    An application of an analogue-video-like feedback effect to an HTML5
    canvas element, with in-browser controls by which the feedback properties
    can be adjusted.  For some background and an explanation
    of how it works, see
    [its README document](https://bitbucket.org/catseye/canvas-feedback/).
  instructions: |
    To begin exploring, we suggest you first try different presets
    from the *Presets* drop-down in the control panel on the right.
    
    You can also paste the URL of an image in the *Image URL* text box,
    and click "Load", to try a different image.
    
    If you want to get your hands dirty, you can open the *Adjustments*
    panel, in which you will find various sliders with which you can
    control all the parameters.
    
    #### How can I save an image?
    
    In Firefox, you can right-click on the canvas and select "View image",
    and save that.  In other browsers, the easiest way may be to click the
    _Pause_ button and take a screenshot.
    (You can thank the security model used in the HTML5 canvas for this.)

    #### The animation isn't perfectly smooth.
    
    This is an unavoidable consequence of your operating system — the
    browser isn't the only thing that's running, and may not get a chance
    to run until it's too late to display the next animation frame.
    
    In other HTML animations, this can be worked around — the animation still
    drops frames, but intermediate steps can be computed so that it doesn't
    look excessively jerky.  However, that is not a realistic option here,
    due to how the feedback process works.
    
    You can minimize frame-dropping by:
    
    *   choosing a relatively small image
    *   finding a sufficiently powerful computer to run it on
    *   making sure you have no other programs running, and no other tabs
        open in your browser
    *   letting your browser "warm up" a bit after closing other tabs etc.,
        so that it doesn't have anything pending to clean up after
    *   **not** moving the mouse pointer.
    
    #### Now my desktop is twisting counter-clockwise!
    
    You've just been staring at it too long.
    
    #### Wait, I see _five-fold symmetry_.  Where is that coming from?
    
    To be honest, I really don't know.

'A Non-Random Walk':
  type: Gewgaw
  development-stage: mature
  defining-distribution: HTML5 Gewgaws distribution
  authors:

  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  inception-date: 2013
  description: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
  # this is partly "notes"
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.
    
    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* × 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

    Animated op art: an interactive bleeding of colours.
  instructions: |
    Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
    {cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
    colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
    of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
    be selected by the slider.
    
    Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
    You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
    several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
    of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)

  instructions: |
    Copy some text of your choosing (from a web page, a local document, etc.)
    and paste it into the text area in the top half of the page.  Then click
    "Uniquify" and see the uniquified text in the bottom half of the page.
    
    Case-sensitive means that `THIS`, `This`, and `this` are treated as different
    words for uniquification purposes.
    
    Punctuation-sensitive means that `this`, `this?`, `"this"` and `(this` are
    treated as different words for uniquification purposes.
    
    You can also select to retain paragraph breaks only (output will look fairly
    similar to the input text), all line breaks (output tends to resemble
    free verse), or no breaks at all (output is one long unbroken stream of text.)
