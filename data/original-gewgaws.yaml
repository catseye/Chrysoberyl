  description: |
    A simple Commodore 64 graphics demo that uses the raster interrupt facility
    of the VIC-II chip: the colour of the border of the screen is inverted,
    but only in the middle part of the screen.  Includes well-commented source
    in 6502 assembly language.

'A Non-Random Walk':
  type: Gewgaw
  development-stage: mature
  defining-distribution: HTML5 Gewgaws distribution
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  inception-date: 2013
  description: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
  # this is partly "notes"
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.
    
    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* × 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

Fibonacci Spiral:

  authors:

  inception-date: 2013
  description: |
    A spiral made up of semicircles with proportions in the Fibonacci sequence.
  instructions: |
    The semicircles alternate being on the left and the right.  The first
    two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are `1, 1` and these make up the unit
    circle in the center of the spiral.
    
    The animation is simply a zooming out and back in on the spiral.

    the "terminal" option to prevent this cycling.

    Each box moves with a constant velocity
    relative to the box it is contained in, and bounces around inside it in a

    Animated op art: an interactive bleeding of colours.
  instructions: |
    Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
    {cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
    colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
    of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
    be selected by the slider.
    
    Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
    You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
    several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
    of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)

    An online tool/amusement where you paste in some text and it displays
    the text with repeated words removed.
  instructions: |
    Copy some text of your choosing (from a web page, a local document, etc.)
    and paste it into the text area in the top half of the page.  Then click
    "Uniquify" and see the uniquified text in the bottom half of the page.
    
    Case-sensitive means that `THIS`, `This`, and `this` are treated as different
    words for uniquification purposes.
    
    Punctuation-sensitive means that `this`, `this?`, `"this"` and `(this` are
    treated as different words for uniquification purposes.
    
    You can also select to retain paragraph breaks only (output will look fairly
    similar to the input text), all line breaks (output tends to resemble
    free verse), or no breaks at all (output is one long unbroken stream of text.)
