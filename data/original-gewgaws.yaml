  description: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    _Mathematical Circus_ by Martin Gardner.
  # this is partly "notes"
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.
    
    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* × 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

    The background colour is beige because it's based on
    [Illuminant E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant#Illuminant_E)

    [what colour the universe is](http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/).

    Animated op art: an interactive bleeding of colours.
  instructions: |
    Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
    {cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
    colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
    of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
    be selected by the slider.
    
    Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
    You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
    several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
    of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)
