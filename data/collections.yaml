"Chris Pressey's Lingography":
  type: Collection
  description: |
    (What is a "lingography", you ask?  Well, if bands have
    _disc_ographies and directors have _film_ographies...)
    
    This is a list, given in approximate chronological order, of the languages
    I've designed and/or implemented.
    It is more-or-less unabridged, but not intended to be *completely* exhaustive.
    Most of these language are programming languages; some of them are
    formal languages, and
    some of them are automata of some kind.  Many of them are esolangs.
    Some of them possibly aren't even languages at all; they just seem to fit
    the general theme of the list.  Most of them have been implemented, and
    these implementations are available in downloadable distrbutions.
    At the bottom there is also a list of languages that I've implemented,
    but which were designed by someone else.
    
    You may also be interested in reading about what it was like to design these
    and/or the ones that got away.  And,
    since the distinction between languages and games is not always that clear,
    you may also be interested in the (much less voluminous)
    list of games I've designed and implemented.
