    (What is a "lingography", you ask?  Well, if bands have
    _disc_-ographies and directors have _film_-ographies...)
    
    This is a list, given in approximate chronological order, of the languages
    I've designed and/or implemented.
    It is more-or-less unabridged, but not intended to be *completely* exhaustive.
    Most of these language are programming languages; some of them are
    formal languages, and
    some of them are automata of some kind.  Many of them are esolangs.
    Some of them possibly aren't even languages at all; they just seem to fit
    the general theme of the list.  Most of them have been implemented, and
    these implementations are available in downloadable distrbutions.
    At the bottom there is also a list of languages that I've implemented,
    but which were designed by someone else.
    
    You may also be interested in reading about
    [[Retrospective: Chris Pressey on Language Design|what it was like to design these]]
    and/or
    [[LoUIE|the ones that got away]].  And,
    since the distinction between languages and games is not always that clear,
    you may also be interested in the (much less voluminous)
    [[Games by Chris Pressey|list of games I've designed and implemented]].

    Here is a list of games that I've designed and implemented.
    It is much less extensive in scope than my
    [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|lingography]],
    but there are perhaps still a few worth mentioning here.
    Besides, the distinction between games and languages is not always that clear...

  summary: A list of "open problems" in esoteric programming language design
  description: |
    Here are some designs for [[Esolang|esoteric programming languages]]
    that I've worked on, but which have turned out to be a bit resistant to
    joining [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|the ranks of the completed]].  You
    could describe them as "open problems" in esolang design â€” but that would
    suggest that the completed designs would be "solutions" to something.  (Ha!)
    
    I've disseminated what little I have for these designs here because it looks
    unlikely that I'll have the time and resources to complete them in the near
    future, and I am a gracious individual who wouldn't want to hoard these
    potentially beautiful things.
    
    If you would like to continue the work on any of these designs, feel free.
    Of course, if you do manage to complete something based on one of them,
    I would appreciate being given some credit (since you are a gracious
    individual as well, right?)

    Well, I figured that if
    [Wouter could have such a page](http://strlen.com/rants/fav_games.html),
    and that since I've been told I have good taste in video games...
    
    Gameplay impresses me far more than the graphics or sound
    effects or "realism" of the game.   Music does has some influence
    on me though, in that an exceptional soundtrack will count for some
    extra points.

    Here is a list of [[Text Adventure|text adventure]] games that I've played (though some of
    them do have supplementary graphics), and, while I'm a bit hesitant to call
    some of them my favourites, I must have enjoyed them enough to remember them.
    You'll notice that I am not actually particularly good at solving these things!
