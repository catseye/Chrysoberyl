    (What is a "lingography", you ask?  Well, if bands have
    _disc_-ographies and directors have _film_-ographies...)
    
    This is a list, given in approximate chronological order, of the languages
    I've designed and/or implemented.
    It is more-or-less unabridged, but not intended to be *completely* exhaustive.
    Most of these language are programming languages; some of them are
    formal languages, and
    some of them are automata of some kind.  Many of them are esolangs.
    Some of them possibly aren't even languages at all; they just seem to fit
    the general theme of the list.  Most of them have been implemented, and
    these implementations are available in downloadable distrbutions.
    At the bottom there is also a list of languages that I've implemented,
    but which were designed by someone else.

  acronym-for: List of Unfinished Interesting Esolangs
  summary: A list of "open problems" in esoteric programming language design
  description: |
    Here are some designs for [[Esolang|esoteric programming languages]]
    that I've worked on, but which have turned out to be a bit resistant to
    joining [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|the ranks of the completed]].  You
    could describe them as "open problems" in esolang design â€” but that would
    suggest that the completed designs would be "solutions" to something.  (Ha!)
    
    I've disseminated what little I have for these designs here because it looks
    unlikely that I'll have the time and resources to complete them in the near
    future, and I am a gracious individual who wouldn't want to hoard these
    potentially beautiful things.
    
    If you would like to continue the work on any of these designs, feel free.
    Of course, if you do manage to complete something based on one of them,
    I would appreciate being given some credit (since you are a gracious
    individual as well, right?)
