    Use the arrow keys to guide the protagonist (represented by a black square)
    around the playfield (represented by a black square) to collect all the
    treasures (represented by black squares) while avoiding the pits (represented
    by black squares.)  Each treasure collected earns the player 10 points; the
    score is shown in the upper-left (in black).  The player begins the game with
    three lives; succumbing to a pit costs a life; the number of lives is
    displayed in the lower-left (in black).  When the game is over, left-click
    the canvas to start a new game.
    
    Detractors and other peasants may satisfy themselves that this is actually a
    game and not just an entirely black gif or something by opening a Javascript
    console and typing `BACKGROUND_COLOR='green'`.
