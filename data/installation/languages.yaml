  description: |
    This is an HTML5 installation of [[BefOS]], a Befunge-themed operating
    system which is neither Befunge, nor an operating system.  (Discuss.)
    It runs on a web page thanks to the
    [[HTML5]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]] emulator, [[v86]].
  instructions: |
    The system is delivered on a 1.44M floppy image, which contains the
    BefOS boot block, kernal, and the handful of sample pages which are
    included in the default build.
    
    If v86 doesn't work in your browser, you can
    [download the disk image](http://catseye.tc/distfiles/befos-0.10.img)
    and use it in an emulator such as [[QEMU]] or [[Bochs]] or [[DOSBox]]
    or, wonder of wonders, a real IBM PC compatible — if you can write it onto
    a floppy disk somehow...

  description: |
    This is [[Shelta]], a language with a tiny compiler and a
    self-hosted compiler, running under [[FreeDOS]] running
    on a web page via the [[HTML5]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]
    emulator, [[v86]] —  so you can bootstrap it right in your browser.
  instructions: |
    The system running online on v86 is delivered on a 720K floppy image,
    which contains a minimal bootable FreeDOS install, the Shelta distribution,
    plus various tools such as the `TED3` text editor, and `YASM`.
    License and distribution information is included on the disk image.
    
    You can use the pre-built Shelta compiler (whose source is written in NASM)
    to build the example programs, or to bootstrap the Shelta compiler
    written in Shelta.  See the welcome message, shown after FreeDOS
    boots, for more details.
    
    Documentation for Shelta is also on the disk image, and can be viewed
    with `TYPE` or `EDIT`, but you may find it more convenient to browse
    these files online:
    
    *   [Original Shelta README, 1999](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/readme.txt)
    *   [Making the Snake Eat its Tail: Bootstrapping](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/bootstrp.txt)

    If v86 doesn't work in your browser, you can
    [download the disk image](http://catseye.tc/distfiles/freedos-1.0-shelta-1.2-floppy-2.img)
    and use it in an emulator such as [[QEMU]] or [[Bochs]] or [[DOSBox]]

'Whothm':
  type: Online Installation
  installation-of: tc.catseye.whothm
  interactive: true

  mediums:
  - Java applet
  - HTML5
  description: |
    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactively try out Whothm programs online. The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.
  instructions: |
    Whothm is a simple language for describing infinite shapes. It is
    described fully in the documentation in the [[Whothm]] distribution.
    
    Click "Run" or press Alt+R to run the program.  The result is displayed in
    the canvas on the right.  Page Up and Page Down can be used to zoom in and
    out of the canvas.
    
    Syntax errors often result in an error message in the status bar,
    but might not in all cases.  In these cases, consulting your browser's
    Java console, if it has one, might elucidate the cause of the error.
    Or it might not.
    
    Obviously, this implementation does not support generating or
    displaying the entire infinite drawing.  In fact, it only runs the loop
    for a couple of hundred iterations.  The full shape is left up to your
    imagination.

    When `INP` is highlighted in the instruction matrix, the program is
    waiting for input.  Click on the Input text box and input some
    `0`s and `1`s (Wunnel programs take bits as input.)  The program
