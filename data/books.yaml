    a.k.a "The Dragon Book".  The classic, borderline-incomprehensible book on compiler construction.

  commentary: |
    The *real* Dragon Book.  This one book is probably responsible for setting me off in
    the direction of programming languages (because it describes how to write a simple
    one-or-two word parser for an an adventure game.)
    
    Also, there are cute pictures of ghosts inside.

    Another Usborne "type in this BASIC game" book.  Not as enlightening as Adventure Programs, but still OK.  Has cute pictures of robots in it.

  commentary: |
    Older computer science book, addressing machine-level programming with
    a sort-of high level language called PL/M, which resembles PL/I.  Really not bad.

  isbn: 0-8306183-6-8
  publisher: TAB
  commentary: |
    Basically a font of mathematical/engineering/physical trivia and
    random ideas for what could be done with a computer.  Although, I'm pretty
    sure they re-published effectively the same book of ideas and [[BASIC]] program
    fragments for every microcomputer on the market at the time, and this just
    happened to the be [[Commodore 64]] one.

  commentary: |
    Classic.  I urge you to read the "crunching" guide on pages 24-27, how the
    screen editor works on pages 94-97, the vaguely condescending
    paragraph at the top of page 153, and the comment on program line 20
    on page 148, and tell me that the [[Commodore 64]] isn't an [[Esolang|esoteric architecture]].

The Cognitive Connection:

  authors:

  - Howard Rheingold
  isbn: 0-1313961-9-6
  commentary: |
    Begins with a disclaimer that it contains at least one error — which turns out
    to be a giant understatement.  The book is riddled with errors, but has a
    great attitude.  Touches on many of the weirder beliefs people have held
    about logic and language through history (for example, the "logic machines"
    of [Ramon Llull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull).)

Patterns of Software:

  authors:
  - Richard P. Gabriel
  isbn: 0-1951212-3-6
  commentary: |
    Kind of goes all over the place, but worthwhile for its comparison of
    [[Object-oriented|object-oriented]] programming to poetic compression,
    and for making a case that beauty may not be subjective.

    Don't worry if you don't know topology — it's not the topology that makes
    this a worthwhile read, it's the counterexamples.

    There are lots of books on computability, but this is one of the earlier ones
    (1967!) and one of the few that treat tarpits with any seriousness.

  commentary: |
    There are lots of books on computability.  This is one of them.  I don't think
    it's the best one, but it's the one that defines the programming language
    "PL" and, more interestingly, its [[Primitive recursive]] subset [[PL-{GOTO}]].

  commentary: |
    Mainly for Zappa's theory of art ("entertainment objects") which describes
    quite nicely how I think of [[Esolang|esolangs]].  The rest of the book is
    pretty interesting too, though.
