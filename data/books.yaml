    a.k.a "The Dragon Book".  The classic, borderline-incomprehensible
    book on compiler construction.

    The *real* Dragon Book.  This one book is probably responsible for setting
    me off in the direction of programming languages (because it describes how
    to write a simple one-or-two word parser for an an adventure game.)
    
    Also, there are cute pictures of ghosts inside.

    Another Usborne "type in this [[BASIC]] game" book.  Not as enlightening as
    [[Write your own Adventure Programs for your Microcomputer|Adventure Programs]],
    but still OK.  Has cute pictures of robots in it.

    Older computer science book, addressing machine-level programming with
    a sort-of high level language called PL/M, which resembles PL/I.  Really
    not bad.

    Basically a font of mathematical/engineering/physical trivia and
    random ideas for what could be done with a computer.  Although, I'm pretty
    sure they re-published effectively the same book of ideas and [[BASIC]]
    program fragments for every microcomputer on the market at the time, and
    this just happened to the be [[Commodore 64]] one.

    Classic.  I urge you to read the "crunching" guide on pages 24-27, how the
    screen editor works on pages 94-97, the vaguely condescending
    paragraph at the top of page 153, and the comment on program line 20
    on page 148, and tell me that the [[Commodore 64]] isn't an
    [[Esolang|esoteric architecture]].

  commentary: |
    Begins with a disclaimer that it contains at least one error — which turns
    out to be a giant understatement.  The book is *riddled* with errors, but
    has a great attitude.  Touches on many of the weirder beliefs people have
    held about logic and language through history (for example, the "logic
    machines" of [Ramon Llull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull).)

  commentary: |
    Kind of goes all over the place, but worthwhile for its comparison of
    [[Object-oriented|object-oriented]] programming to poetic compression,
    and for making a case that beauty may not be subjective.

    Don't worry if you don't know topology — it's not the topology that makes
    this a worthwhile read, it's the counterexamples.

    There are lots of books on computability, but this is one of the earlier
    ones (1967!) and one of the few that treat tarpits with any seriousness.

    There are lots of books on computability.  This is one of them.  I don't
    think it's the best one, but it's the one that defines the programming
    language "PL" and, more interestingly, PL's
    [[Primitive recursive|primitive recursive]] subset [[PL-{GOTO}]].

    Mainly for Zappa's theory of art ("entertainment objects") which describes
    quite nicely how I think of [[Esolang|esolangs]].  The rest of the book is
    pretty interesting too, though.
