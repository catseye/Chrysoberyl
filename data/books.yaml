    a.k.a "The Dragon Book".  The classic, borderline-incomprehensible book on compiler construction.

    The *real* Dragon Book.  This one book is probably responsible for setting me off in
    the direction of programming languages (because it describes how to write a simple
    one-or-two word parser for an an adventure game.)
    
    Also, there are cute pictures of ghosts inside.

    Another Usborne "type in this BASIC game" book.  Not as enlightening as Adventure Programs, but still OK.  Has cute pictures of robots in it.

    Older computer science book, addressing machine-level programming with
    a sort-of high level language called PL/M, which resembles PL/I.  Really not bad.

  commentary: |
    Basically a font of mathematical/engineering/physical trivia and
    random ideas for what could be done with a computer.  Although, I'm pretty
    sure they re-published effectively the same book of ideas and [[BASIC]] program
    fragments for every microcomputer on the market at the time, and this just
    happened to the be [[Commodore 64]] one.

Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide:

    Classic.  I urge you to read the "crunching" guide on pages 24-27, how the
    screen editor works on pages 94-97, the vaguely condescending
    paragraph at the top of page 153, and the comment on program line 20
    on page 148, and tell me that the [[Commodore 64]] isn't an [[Esolang|esoteric architecture]].

    #~ Excellent textbook on algorithms.

#~ ====The Cognitive Connection: Thought and Language in Man and Machine====
#~ ''by Howard Levine and Howard Rheingold'' -- ISBN 0-1313961-9-6

#~ Begins with a disclaimer that it contains at least one error -- which turns out to be a giant understatement.  The book is riddled with errors, but has a great attitude.  Touches on many of the weirder beliefs people have held about logic and language through history (for example, the "logic machines" of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull Ramon Llull].)

#~ ====Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community====
#~ ''by Richard P Gabriel'' -- ISBN 0-1951212-3-6

#~ Kind of goes all over the place, but worthwhile for its comparison of object-oriented programming to poetic compression, and for making a case that beauty may not be subjective.

#~ ====Counterexamples in Topology====
#~ ''by Lynn Arthur Steen and J. Arthur Seebach Jr.'' -- ISBN 0-4866873-5-X

#~ Don't worry if you don't know topology -- it's not the topology that makes this a worthwhile read, it's the counterexamples.

#~ ====Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines====
#~ ''by Marvin Minsky'' -- ISBN 0-1316556-3-9

#~ There are lots of books on computability, but this is one of the earlier ones (1967!) and one of the few that treat tarpits with any seriousness.

#~ ====The Real Frank Zappa Book====
#~ ''by Frank Zappa and Peter Occhiogrosso'' -- ISBN 0-6717057-2-5

#~ Mainly for Zappa's theory of art ("entertainment objects") which describes quite nicely how I think of esolangs.  The rest of the book is pretty interesting too, though.
