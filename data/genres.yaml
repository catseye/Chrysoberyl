    While there is no hard and fast definition, an esoteric programming
    language, or "esolang", is a programming language intended to entertain,
    confuse, and otherwise blow your puny little mind. If that sometimes
    means butchering the definition of "[[Programming Language|programming language]]"... then so be
    it.
    
    Esolangs are toy languages, if by "toy" you mean something like
    ["Mainway
    product"](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76jconsumerprobe.phtml).
    
    Esolangs are joke languages, if by "joke" you mean something like
    ["Beethoven scherzo."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scherzo)
    
    Esolangs are research languages, if by "research" you mean something
    like ["Fear and Loathing in Las
    Vegas."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm7r491n-8o)
    
    A comprehensive repository of information
    on esolangs can be found at the
    [Esolang Wiki](http://www.esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page).
