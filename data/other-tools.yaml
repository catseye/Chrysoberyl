ANSI Terminal:
  type: Tool
  specification-link: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm
  as-a-prerequisite: |
    Executables of this project need to run in a terminal which understand
    the ANSI terminal control codes (more formally known as "ECMA-48") in
    order for their output to be intelligible. Almost all modern consoles
    and terminal emulators understand these codes, sometimes under the guise
    of a particular terminal standard which includes them, such as `vt100`
    or `vt220`. For older MS-DOS systems, a driver such as `ANSI.SYS` may
    need to be loaded.

Borland C++:
  type: Implementation
  implementation-of: C++
  reference: no
  license: Proprietary
  # I can't guarantee this but I bet
  host-language: C++
  host-platform: MS-DOS
  prebuilt-for-platforms:
  - MS-DOS
  target-language: 80286 machine code
  implementation-type: compiler
  as-a-prequisite: |
    The source code for this project was developed with Borland C++ 3.1
    (although it is almost certainly written in C, not C++.) It may use
    Borland C++-specific extensions and libraries. Borland C++ 3.1 is not
    free software, although you can apparently download a set of Borland's
    later tools free of charge. I don't know if they'd be useful to compile
    these sources.
    
    Note that there are no projects at Cat's Eye Technologies that strictly
    require Borland C++ anymore; they've all been converted to use portable
    features (such as [[ANSI Terminal]] control codes and should
    be quite buildable with any conforming [[C99]] compiler.

make:
  type: Tool
  specification-link: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/make.html
  links:
  - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
  as-a-prerequisite: |
    In order to build this project automatically, you will need a `make`
    utility capable of handling fairly generic Makefiles. GNU `make` should
    be generally capable of handling these kind of Makefiles.
    
    Without a `make`, you can still build the project; you will just have to
    find another way to invoke the compiler (or whatever) on all the source
    files.

Parsec:

  as-a-prerequisite: |
    This [[Haskell]] project uses the Parsec parser combinator library to
    define a parser. Parsec comes with some implementations of Haskell, and
    if it didn't come with yours, it's available as a [Cabal
    package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.1).
