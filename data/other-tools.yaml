    I think the only thing that requires MS-DOS is shelta; and even then, it might

    [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) is a compatibility layer for Windows
    which lets you build and run software which expects a Unix-like
    operating system.
  commentary: |    
    Cygwin is really nice when you're stuck using Windows, but you want to
    play with [open-source software](opensource.html), most of which expects
    to be run on a Unix-like operating system.
    
    But there is one annoying thing about Cygwin: in its default install,
    you have to use it through a console window, of the kind provided by
    Windows for running Command Prompt. The editing capabilities and general
    usability of this console window are just short of atrocious.
    
    Fortunately, on modern Windowses, you're not stuck with this: you can
    make Cygwin use a PowerShell window. While not paradise, it's not quite
    as frustrating to use. Here's how to set it up:
    
    1.  Find PowerShell on your Windows installation. The easiest way to do
        this is probably to use the search facility in the Start menu, and
        type in `powershell`.
    2.  Once you find an icon for PowerShell, create a shortcut for it.
        Alt-drag it to the desktop or something.
    3.  Edit the properties of that shortcut. The target will be something
        like `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.
        Add the location of your `cygwin.bat` file to it, so that it's
        something like:
        `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat`.
    4.  Probably you should rename your shortcut "Cygwin Powershell" or
        something, to minimize confusion.
    5.  Double-click your new shortcut. It should totally just work.
