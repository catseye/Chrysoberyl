    The original idea was this: each ball travels on a
    sine-wave path (kind of like a spring) between a randomly-chosen
    pair of two other balls.
    
    It was soon discovered that if all balls are free to move like this,
    they all quickly collapse to a single point.  Thus, some number of
    balls are held fixed (5% by default).  The result is a slightly
    organic-seeming emergent motion.

  description: |
    Cyclobots is an automaton that consists of a number of little virtual
    "turtle robots" called "cyclobots".  Each cyclobot moves with a constant
    velocity, and tries to follow exactly one other cyclobot, adjusting
    its heading to point towards the cyclobot it is following.
    No cylobot is followed by more than one cyclobot.
    
    A group of cyclobots tends to fall into one of several semi-stable
    patterns.  The simplest of these is just a rotating circle, but
    more complex, [trefoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot)-like
    patterns are more common.
