  byline: Designed and implemented by Chris Pressey
  abstract: |-
    <p>A video game I wrote for the Commodore 64 where you must
        guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  Was originally written
        in BASIC by a young me in the 80's.  Was rewritten in 6502 assembly
        language by a middle-aged me in the late oughts.  Was pared down so
        that (crunched) it fit into 2K, and was submitted to the
        <em>Mini Game Competition 2009</em>
        where (surprisingly, to me!) it got first place in its class.</p>
        <p>This distribution contains the original version, binaries and
        source code for the 2K version, and an 8K cartridge version.</p>

  title: 'Falderal: Literate Testing for Languages'
  summary: Literate Testing framework for Literate Haskell
  byline: 
  abstract: |-
    <p>Falderal is a file format for literate test suites.  It is particularly
    suited for documenting programming languages (or other specifications of
    ways to transform text) and testing their implementation(s) in a
    language-agnostic fashion.  The dumbed-down sound-bite version: &quot;doctests
    for DSLs&quot;.  <code>Test.Falderal</code> is the reference implementation, in Haskell,
    of tools for formatting and running tests written in Falderal.

pl-goto.net:
  title: PL-{GOTO}.NET
  summary: MSIL compiler for <b>PL-{GOTO}</b>
  byline: Implemented by Chris Pressey
  abstract: |-
    <p>PL-{GOTO}.NET is a compiler for the language PL-{GOTO}
        from Brainerd and Landweber's <i>Theory of Computation</i>
        (1974; ISBN 0471095850). PL-{GOTO} can express exactly the
        primitive recursive functions, and thus PL-{GOTO} programs
        always terminate. PL-{GOTO}.NET generates MSIL code which
        can then (using <code>ilasm</code>) be turned into a .NET
        executable.  It can also execute PL-{GOTO} programs
        directly.</p>

    <p>The Thue programming language was invented by
    John Colagioia in early 2000.  It is named after the computational
    regimen it is based on — a pure string-rewriting process called a
    <dfn>semi-Thue grammar</dfn>, which is named for (and possibly created
    by) the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue (pronounced &quot;TOO-ay&quot;).</p>
        <p>Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways
    to construe constraint-based programming.  It is to the constraint-based
    paradigm what languages like OISC are to the imperative paradigm;
    in other words, it's a tar pit.</p>
