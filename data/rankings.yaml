    Well, I figured that if
    [Wouter could have such a page](http://strlen.com/rants/fav_games.html),
    and that since I've been told I have good taste in video games...
    
    Gameplay impresses me far more than the graphics or sound
    effects or "realism" of the game.   Music does has some influence
    on me though, in that an exceptional soundtrack will count for some
    extra points.
