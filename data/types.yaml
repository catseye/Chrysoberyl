    Welcome to the section of our website dedicated to our
    **entertainment objects that can be enjoyed online**.

    Welcome to Cat's Eye Technologies' Gallery, the section of our website
    for the exhibition of our works made available online.
    
    What this means, in practice, is that they stand alone as works, and
    can be viewed and interacted with directly in your web browser, without
    you having to download anything.
    
    Historically, to experience one of our [[Esolang|esolangs]], you would
    have to download and install at least some development tools (such as a
    language interpreter.)
    
    Now, however, we are using the word "installation" in the sense it is
    used by artists — *something put somewhere*, basically — and from this
    point forward, we hope to have most of our esolangs (and our other
    things) *installed online*.
    
    The great majority of these online installations are implemented in
    [[HTML5]] with [[Javascript]], to maximize their accessibility.  Some
    are implemented as [[Java]]™ applets which run in the browser instead.
    
    To conserve page space, many of the installations have a button in the
    upper-right that you can click for more information about that work.
    Look for it.

    If you find this chart a little daunting, I don't blame you, and you might
    want to start exploring [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' programming language

    * [[Esolang]]
    * [[Automaton|Automata]] — which, rather arbitrarily, aren't listed here

Gewgaw:
  type: type
  description: |
    In [[Chrysoberyl]] parlance, a _gewgaw_ is the digital version of a
    bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
    visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.
    It need not be implemented in [[HTML5]], but many of
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' gewgaws are.
    
    A special kind of gewgaw, for which there is a whole historical "scene",
    is the "demo".  We avoid that terminology here, partly because it has
    other useful meanings, and partly because demos have a certain thrust
    which gewgaws need not have (pushing the limits of a computer, being
    very visually/aurally impressive, sending "greetings" to other demosceners,
    etc.)

Text:
  type: type
  description: |
    Texts. But isn't everything in [[Chrysoberyl]] a text
    of some sort?  Yes, but those are texts *about* something.
    These are texts that stand as works on their own.
    
    Note that concrete poetry and the like may be
    categorized under Texts, or Pictures, or both.
