    The latest news from [[Cat's Eye Technologies]].

    Welcome to Cat's Eye Technologies' Gallery, the section of our website for the
    exhibition of works made available online, in your web browser, implemented
    as [[Java]]™ applets, or in [[HTML5]] with [[Javascript]].  The works fall
    into three main exhibits:
    
    *   [[Esolang|Esoteric programming languages]] with which you can experiment.
        By selecting sample
        programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of how the
        esolang computes stuff; by composing your own programs, you can gain an
        even better appreciation.
    *   Programs (primarily games) written for the [[Commodore 64]], powered by
        the [[JaC64]] Java™ applet, which allows you to run these programs in
        your web browser.
    *   Digital art (audiovisual, animated, interactive, or otherwise) for you to
        experience online.

  commentary: |
    There are two things about programming languages that every programmer
    should know.
    
    One is that a programming language is an abstract entity. Much like
    Beethoven's 7th Symphony, it just doesn't exist in the same sense a tree
    or a street exists. Sure, there are *recordings* of *performances* of
    Beethoven's 7th, and there are *transcriptions* of Beethoven's 7th, but
    these are only attempts to capture the symphony, they aren't the
    symphony itself.
    
    Simlarly, take a programming language, like [[Java]]. There are
    implementations of Java — there's Sun's `javac`, for instance, but
    there are also IBM's `jikes` and GNU's `gcj`. And there are
    specifications of Java — the official spec is from Sun (much like the
    official version of Beethoven's 7th issued straight from Ludwig von's
    pen,) but there are countless books on learning Java that also explain
    the features and rules of Java, in their own words.
    
    In short, languages aren't the tools that implement them or the
    documents that describe them.
    
    Ponder this fact, for fully appreciating it will mean you'll be able to
    save yourself from appearing ignorant by referring to how this or that
    language is "not fast enough" or "widely available."
    
    The other thing that every programmer should know about programming
    languages is that it's very important to choose the right programming
    language for every software project. That's why you'll always choose
    [[C++]] no matter *what* the software project is.
