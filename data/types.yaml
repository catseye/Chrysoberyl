    This is a list of all works installed online on [[catseye.tc]].
    
    This list is of _all_ works!  You may have better luck navigating
    the online installations by going to the [front page](/) and
    browsing by one of the categories: **[[Programming Language]],**
    **[[Gewgaw]], [[Game]], [[Musical Composition]], [[Picture]], [[Text]],**
    **[[Tool]], [[Electronics Project]],** or **[[Retrocomputing]]**.

    This category is a little weird, because there are genres for
    [[Programming Language|programming languages]], [[Game|games]],
    [[Musical Composition|music]], and [[Book|books]], all mixed together here.

  description: |
    A game is anything you can play, but most of these are meant
    to be played on a computer.  Some can even be played online
    here, in your web browser.
    
    Note that the distinctions between a Game and a [[Gewgaw]]
    or even an [[Automaton]] are not always clear, and entries
    here may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.

Programming Language:

  description: |
    Some of these languages have interpreters that can run online,
    in your web browser.  By selecting sample
    programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of how the
    language works; by composing your own programs, you can gain an
    even better appreciation.

    a [[Programming Language Family]], and an [[Automaton]]
    are debatable, and entries may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.

    _[[What is this I don't even]]: Oh god how did this get here I am not good
    with synthesizer_ is the working title for [[Chris Pressey]]'s ongoing
    musical composition project.
    
    Many of these tunes can be listened to online, if you have a
    web browser that supports [[HTML5]] [[mp3]] audio or if you
    have an Adobe Flash™ plugin.

    Note that concrete poetry and the like may be

Gewgaw:
  type: type
  description: |
    In [[Chrysoberyl]] parlance, a _gewgaw_ is the digital version of a
    bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
    visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.
    
    A gewgaw need not be implemented in [[HTML5]], but many of
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' gewgaws are, and you can can experience
    them here, online, right in your web browser.
    
    Note that the distinctions between a Gewgaw and an [[Automaton]] or
    even a [[Game]] are not always clear, and entries here may be categorized
    somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    A special kind of gewgaw, for which there is a whole historical "scene",
    is the "demo".  We avoid that terminology here, partly because it has
    other useful meanings, and partly because demos have a certain thrust
    which gewgaws need not have (pushing the limits of a computer, being
    very visually/aurally impressive, sending "greetings" to other demosceners,
    etc.)

    Texts. But isn't everything in [[Chrysoberyl]] a text
    of some sort?  Yes, but those are texts *about* something.
    These are texts that stand as works on their own.

    Note that the precise distinction between a Text
    and a [[Book]] is debatable, and entries here may be
    categorized somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    Note that concrete poetry and the like may be
    categorized under Texts, or [[Picture]]s, or both.
