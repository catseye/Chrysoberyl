    A game is anything you can play, but most of these are meant
    to be played on a computer.  Some can even be played online
    here, in your web browser.
    
    Note that the distinctions between a Game and a [[Gewgaw]]
    or even an [[Automaton]] are not always clear, and entries
    here may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.

    Some of these languages have interpreters that can run online,
    in your web browser.  By selecting sample
    programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of how the
    language works; by composing your own programs, you can gain an
    even better appreciation.

Gewgaw:
  type: type
  description: |
    In [[Chrysoberyl]] parlance, a _gewgaw_ is the digital version of a
    bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
    visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.
    
    A gewgaw need not be implemented in [[HTML5]], but many of
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' gewgaws are, and you can can experience
    them here, online, right in your web browser.
    
    Note that the distinctions between a Gewgaw and an [[Automaton]] or
    even a [[Game]] are not always clear, and entries here may be categorized
    somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    A special kind of gewgaw, for which there is a whole historical "scene",
    is the "demo".  We avoid that terminology here, partly because it has
    other useful meanings, and partly because demos have a certain thrust
    which gewgaws need not have (pushing the limits of a computer, being
    very visually/aurally impressive, sending "greetings" to other demosceners,
    etc.)

    Texts. But isn't everything in [[Chrysoberyl]] a text
    of some sort?  Yes, but those are texts *about* something.
    These are texts that stand as works on their own.
    
    Note that concrete poetry and the like may be
    categorized under Texts, or Pictures, or both.
