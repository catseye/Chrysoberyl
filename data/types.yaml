    Welcome to Cat's Eye Technologies' Gallery, the section of our website for the
    exhibition of works made available online.  All are composed in
    [[HTML5]] with [[Javascript]], except where noted (some are implemented
    as [[Java]]™ applets instead.)  **Note:**
    to conserve page space, many of the installations have a button in the
    upper-right that you can click for more information about that work.
    Look for it.

  commentary: |
    What's the difference between an automaton and a
    [[Programming Language|programming language]] and a calculus
    and a model of computation?  Precious little, I'm afraid — under many
    circumstances you can consider them just about interchangeable.  There
    are subtleties, and I'll try to write something about those subtleties
    at some point.  But don't be too surprised when they (seemingly
    arbitrarily) get lumped together here, and when they (seemingly
    arbitrarily) don't.
Programming Language:
  type: type

    This is a matrix of all the programming languages known to [[Chrysoberyl]],
    collating them with known implementations of those languages, and things
    known to be implemented in those languages.
    
    If you find this chart a little daunting, I don't blame you, and you might
    want to start exploring [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' programming language
    materials from some other page:
    
    * [[Chris Pressey's Lingography]]
    * [[Esolang]]
    * [[Automaton|Automata]] — which, rather arbitrarily, aren't listed here
    * [[Programming Languages as an Artistic Medium]]
    * [[The Aesthetics of Esolangs]]

  commentary: |
    There are two things about programming languages that every programmer
    should know.
    
    One is that a programming language is an abstract entity. Much like
    Beethoven's 7th Symphony, it just doesn't exist in the same sense a tree
    or a street exists. Sure, there are *recordings* of *performances* of
    Beethoven's 7th, and there are *transcriptions* of Beethoven's 7th, but
    these are only attempts to capture the symphony, they aren't the
    symphony itself.
    
    Simlarly, take a programming language, like [[Java]]. There are
    implementations of Java — there's Sun's `javac`, for instance, but
    there are also IBM's `jikes` and GNU's `gcj`. And there are
    specifications of Java — the official spec is from Sun (much like the
    official version of Beethoven's 7th issued straight from Ludwig von's
    pen,) but there are countless books on learning Java that also explain
    the features and rules of Java, in their own words.
    
    In short, languages aren't the tools that implement them or the
    documents that describe them.
    
    Ponder this fact, for fully appreciating it will mean you'll be able to
    save yourself from appearing ignorant by referring to how this or that
    language is "not fast enough" or "widely available."
    
    The other thing that every programmer should know about programming
    languages is that it's very important to choose the right programming
    language for every software project. That's why you'll always choose
    [[C++]] no matter *what* the software project is.

Gewgaw:
  type: type
  description: |
    In [[Chrysoberyl]] parlance, a gewgaw is the digital version of a
    bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
    visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.
    It need not be implemented in [[HTML5]], but many of
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' gewgaws are.
    
    A special kind of gewgaw, for which there is a whole historical "scene",
    is the "demo".  We avoid that terminology here, partly because it has
    other useful meanings, and partly because demos have a certain thrust
    which gewgaws need not have (pushing the limits of a computer, being
    very visually/aurally impressive, sending "greetings" to other demosceners,
    etc.)

# these are implementables too, but that property is less exploited for them
