    This is a matrix of all the programming languages known to [[Chrysoberyl]],
    collating them with known implementations of those languages, and things
    known to be implemented in those languages.
    
    Some of these languages have interpreters that can run online,
    in your web browser.  By selecting sample
    programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of how the
    language works; by composing your own programs, you can gain an
    even better appreciation.
    
    Note that the precise distinctions between a Programming Language,
    a [[Programming Language Family]], and an [[Automaton]]
    are debatable, and entries may be categorized somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    If you find this chart a little daunting, I don't blame you, and you might
    want to start exploring [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' programming language
    materials from some other page:

    have an Adobe Flash™ plugin.

Gewgaw:
  type: type
  description: |
    In [[Chrysoberyl]] parlance, a _gewgaw_ is the digital version of a
    bagatelle (music) or a doodle (visual art).  It almost always involves
    visuals (usually animated), sometimes audio, and occasionally interaction.
    
    A gewgaw need not be implemented in [[HTML5]], but many of
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' gewgaws are, and you can can experience
    them here, online, right in your web browser.
    
    Note that the distinctions between a Gewgaw and an [[Automaton]] or
    even a [[Game]] are not always clear, and entries here may be categorized
    somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    A special kind of gewgaw, for which there is a whole historical "scene",
    is the "demo".  We avoid that terminology here, partly because it has
    other useful meanings, and partly because demos have a certain thrust
    which gewgaws need not have (pushing the limits of a computer, being
    very visually/aurally impressive, sending "greetings" to other demosceners,
    etc.)

    Texts. But isn't everything in [[Chrysoberyl]] a text
    of some sort?  Yes, but those are texts *about* something.
    These are texts that stand as works on their own.

    Note that the precise distinction between a Text
    and a [[Book]] is debatable, and entries here may be
    categorized somewhat arbitrarily.
    
    Note that concrete poetry and the like may be
    categorized under Texts, or [[Picture]]s, or both.
