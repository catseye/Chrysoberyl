'Console::Virtual':
  type: Library
  summary: Package for simulating a virtual console
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  abstract: |-
    `Console::Virtual` is a simple, lightweight abstraction layer which
    allows a program to interact with the user through a console, which
    is emulated on whatever user interface is really available.

crone: 
  type: Tool
  summary: Simple, non-polling cron-like scheduler
  byline: 
  abstract: |-
    `crone` is a simple `cron`-like facility.  Unlike most `cron`s, it does
    not periodically activate and run whatever tasks are due to run; instead
    it calculates the amount of time between now and when the next is due
    to run, and sleeps exactly that long.

  title: 'Falderal: Literate Testing for Languages'
  summary: Literate Testing framework for Literate Haskell
  byline: 
  abstract: |-
    <p>Falderal is a file format for literate test suites.  It is particularly
    suited for documenting programming languages (or other specifications of
    ways to transform text) and testing their implementation(s) in a
    language-agnostic fashion.  The dumbed-down sound-bite version: &quot;doctests
    for DSLs&quot;.  <code>Test.Falderal</code> is the reference implementation, in Haskell,
    of tools for formatting and running tests written in Falderal.

    <p>This is a static analyzer, written in Scheme, which can check if
    given Scheme procedures are total (always terminate, on any input) by checking that
    they are specified primitive-recursively.  What's more, it is written almost entirely in
    a primitive-recursive style, so it can check itself!</p>

    <p><em>yoob</em> is a framework for implementing esoteric
        programming languages in Java. It aims to make it easy for a user
        to experiment with a large number of esolangs with a minimal
        install burden (i.e. in a Java applet), and to make it easy for
        designers to rapidly implement and showcase their esolangs.</p>
