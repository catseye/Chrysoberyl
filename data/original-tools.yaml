  authors:

  description: |
    **Funicular** is a system that semi-automates the creation of development
    environments on eclectic architectures. "Semi-automate" means it automates
    what it can, and provides repeatable instructions for you to follow for
    what it can't.
    
    "Eclectic architectures" is not terribly-well defined, but it includes
    retrocomputing and esoteric architectures.  Basically, if you've got an
    emulator for it and install and support images for it, you might be able
    to install and outfit and and run a system for it, using Funicular.
    
    It replaces [[Amiga Gondola]].  It can handle such OS/emulator combinations
    as [[AmigaDOS 1.3]] under [[E-UAE]] emulating an [[Amiga 500]],
    [[FreeDOS]] under [[QEMU]], and [[NetBSD]] under [[QEMU]].
