  description: |
    **Funicular** is a system that semi-automates the creation of development
    environments on eclectic architectures. "Semi-automate" means it automates
    what it can, and provides repeatable instructions for you to follow for
    what it can't.
    
    "Eclectic architectures" is not terribly-well defined, but it includes
    retrocomputing and esoteric architectures.  Basically, if you've got an
    emulator for it and install and support images for it, you might be able
    to install and outfit and and run a system for it, using Funicular.
    
    It replaces [[Amiga Gondola]].  It can handle such OS/emulator combinations
    as [[AmigaDOS 1.3]] under [[E-UAE]] emulating an [[Amiga 500]],
    [[FreeDOS]] under [[QEMU]], and [[NetBSD]] under [[QEMU]].

    This is a static analyzer, written in Scheme, which can check if
    given Scheme procedures are total (always terminate, on any input) by
    checking that they are specified primitive-recursively.  What's more, it
    is written almost entirely in a primitive-recursive style, so it can
    check itself!

transmat: 
  type: Tool
  summary: An unremarkable but fairly robust network synchronization tool
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  description: |
    `transmat` is a network synchronization tool written in Python. It is not
    particularly remarkable, but since it has been used in hostile
    environments at points (e.g. unreliable dial-up connections, and
    [[Cygwin]] on Vista,) it does go to some lengths to be robust, to support
    lousy protocols (namely FTP), and to minimize transmission time during
    synchronization.

  description: |
    T-Rext is a command-line filter that attempts to clean up spaces and
    punctuation in a text file.  Its purpose is so that, when you are writing
    a text generator, such as a Markov processor, you need not worry too much
    about its output format; just toss its output through T-Rext when you're
    done to make it more presentable.

  description: |
    `yucca` is a dialect-agnostic static analyzer for 8-bit BASIC
    programs.  It can find `GOTO`'s and `GOSUB`'s
    which refer to non-existent line numbers, or line numbers which contain
    only a `REM`, among a few other modest features.
