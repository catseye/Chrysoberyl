'Console::Virtual':
  type: Library
  summary: Package for simulating a virtual console
  authors:

  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  abstract: |-
    `Console::Virtual` is a simple, lightweight abstraction layer which
    allows a program to interact with the user through a console, which
    is emulated on whatever user interface is really available.

crone: 
  type: Tool
  summary: Simple, non-polling cron-like scheduler
  authors:

  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  abstract: |-
    `crone` is a simple `cron`-like facility.  Unlike most `cron`s, it does
    not periodically activate and run whatever tasks are due to run; instead
    it calculates the amount of time between now and when the next is due
    to run, and sleeps exactly that long.

  abstract: |-
    Falderal is a file format for literate test suites.  It is particularly
    suited for documenting programming languages (or other specifications of
    ways to transform text) and testing their implementation(s) in a
    language-agnostic fashion.  The dumbed-down sound-bite version:
    "doctests for DSLs".  It can be embedded in both Markdown and Literate
    Haskell.

  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  abstract: |-
    This is a static analyzer, written in Scheme, which can check if
    given Scheme procedures are total (always terminate, on any input) by
    checking that they are specified primitive-recursively.  What's more, it
    is written almost entirely in a primitive-recursive style, so it can
    check itself!

  authors:

  abstract: |-
    `yoob` is a framework for implementing esoteric programming languages
    in Java.  It aims to make it easy for a user to experiment with a large
    number of esolangs with a minimal install burden (i.e. in a Java applet),
    and to make it easy for designers to rapidly implement and showcase
    their esolangs.

  abstract: |-
    `yucca` is a dialect-agnostic static analyzer for 8-bit BASIC
    programs.  It can find `GOTO`'s and `GOSUB`'s
    which refer to non-existent line numbers, or line numbers which contain
    only a `REM`, among a few other modest features.
