    `crone` is a simple `cron`-like facility.  Unlike most `cron`s, it does

    it calculates the amount of time between now and when the next is due
    to run, and sleeps exactly that long.

    "doctests for DSLs".  It can be embedded in both Markdown and Literate
    Haskell.

  description: |
    Rooibos is a parser combinator library for Python. Modelled somewhat
    after yeanpypa (self-contained, public domain), but compensates for what
    I considered a fatal flaw in yeanpypa (no good way to describe a
    recursive grammar.) Has a fatal flaw of its own (can only parse
    strictly LL(1) grammars â€” no backtracking is yet possible.) Originally
    used in [[Eightebed]], but provided here for ease of transplanting into
    other projects.

    `transmat` is a network synchronization tool written in Python. It is not
    particularly remarkable, but since it has been used in hostile
    environments at points (e.g. unreliable dial-up connections, and
    [[Cygwin]] on Vista,) it does go to some lengths to be robust, to support
    lousy protocols (namely FTP), and to minimize transmission time during
    synchronization.
