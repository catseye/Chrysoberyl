Rooibos:
  type: Library
  summary: Simple, single-module parser combinator library
  authors:

  description: |
    Rooibos is a parser combinator library for Python. Modelled somewhat
    after yeanpypa (self-contained, public domain), but compensates for what
    I considered a fatal flaw in yeanpypa (no good way to describe a
    recursive grammar.) Has a fatal flaw of its own (can only parse
    strictly LL(1) grammars â€” no backtracking is yet possible.) Originally
    used in [[Eightebed]], but provided here for ease of transplanting into
    other projects.

toolshelf: 
  type: Tool
  summary: A "package manager" that doesn't actually install anything

  description: |
    `toolshelf` is a "package manager" which doesn't actually install any files.
    Instead, it stores the source trees of sundry packages in a single directory,
    and manages your search paths to include the relevant subdirectories of
    those trees. The source trees are typically the working directories of
    local git or Mercurial clones, or they can be source distributions from tarballs.

TPiS: 
  type: Tool
  subtitle: Total Procedures in Scheme
  summary: Totality-checker for Scheme procedures
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  auspices:
  - Cat's Eye Technologies
  description: |
    This is a static analyzer, written in Scheme, which can check if
    given Scheme procedures are total (always terminate, on any input) by
    checking that they are specified primitive-recursively.  What's more, it
    is written almost entirely in a primitive-recursive style, so it can
    check itself!
