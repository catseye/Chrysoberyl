    <p>Apple Befunge is a variant of Befunge for the Apple ][+, implemented
        in Applesoft BASIC.
        Resembles Befunge-93, with some extra 96-esque instructions, and some
        Apple-specific instructions.  Active development of this language
        was abandoned years ago, but the sources are retained here for historical preservation.</p>
  develop: |-
    Although Apple Befunge is no longer being actively developed, its sources are stored in a 
         <a class="external" href="https://bitbucket.org/catseye/apple-befunge/">Mercurial repository</a> hosted on
         <a class="external" href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> that you can clone.

    <p>PL-{GOTO}.NET is a compiler for the language PL-{GOTO}
        from Brainerd and Landweber's <i>Theory of Computation</i>
        (1974; ISBN 0471095850). PL-{GOTO} can express exactly the
        primitive recursive functions, and thus PL-{GOTO} programs
        always terminate. PL-{GOTO}.NET generates MSIL code which
        can then (using <code>ilasm</code>) be turned into a .NET
        executable.  It can also execute PL-{GOTO} programs

  summary: Interpreter for the <b>Thue</b> language

  abstract: |-
    <p>The Thue programming language was invented by
    John Colagioia in early 2000.  It is named after the computational
    regimen it is based on — a pure string-rewriting process called a
    <dfn>semi-Thue grammar</dfn>, which is named for (and possibly created
    by) the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue (pronounced &quot;TOO-ay&quot;).</p>
        <p>Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways
    to construe constraint-based programming.  It is to the constraint-based
    paradigm what languages like OISC are to the imperative paradigm;
    in other words, it's a tar pit.</p>
