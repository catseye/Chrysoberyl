    Hi, I'm Chris Pressey, and I'm a programming language composer.
    
    You can *too* be a programming language composer!
    [[Frank Zappa]] [says so!](http://theshermanfoundation.blogspot.ca/2006/07/art-school-at-sherman-foundation-frank.html)
    
    In truth, I used to be a regular composer -- that is, a composer of
    [[Musical Composition|music]] -- but I decided that, if I was going to be unappreciated,
    I might as well be unappreciated by a much, much smaller audience.
    (Anyone can listen to music.  Not so many people can program.)
    
    When I'm not composing programming languages, sometimes I compose
    the occasional retrogame.
  old-homepage: |
    Hello! I'm Chris Pressey. [I design programming
    languages](retrospective.html). [Lots of 'em](lingography.html).
    Unfortunately, there's no money in that, so to support my
    three-times-a-day "food" habit I have a day job as a ~~computer
    programmer~~ ~~systems analyst~~ ~~software developer~~ ~~software
    engineer~~ ~~bit rassler~~ ~~cyborg babysitter~~ cable layer in a
    Tinkertoy warehouse.
    
    In addition to languages, I also [write the occasional computer
    game](games.html).
    
    I'm also active in [open-source](/about/opensource.html) development
    (time permitting, of course.) Apart from all the [BSD
    licensed](/projects/bsdl.html) projects at Cat's Eye Technologies, I've
    also contributed to [The BSD Installer](http://www.bsdinstaller.org/),
    [DragonFlyBSD](http://www.dragonflybsd.org/),
    [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/) (ports),
    [Perl](http://www.perl.com/), [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/),
    [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), and [VICE](http://www.viceteam.org/).
    
    Things I Like
    -------------
    
    -   programming languages (especially [esolangs](../about/esolang.html),
        continuations, [reflection](../projects/refl.html), and abstract
        interpretation)
    -   [theory of computation](../projects/theory.html) (computability,
        [universality](../about/universality.html), termination,
        [rewriting](/projects/rew.html))
    -   axiomatic mathematics (abstract algebra, topology, sometimes even
        (*gakk*) category theory)
    -   8-bit computers ([Commodore 64](../projects/cbm.html), Apple ][,
        Sinclair ZX81)
    -   arcade and video games (too many to list here, so they have [their
        own page](vids.html))
    -   [adventure games](adventure-games.html) (nowadays known as
        "interactive fiction")
    -   [electronics](../projects/elec.html)
    -   music composition
    -   hiking
    
    Things I Could Do Without
    -------------------------
    
    -   [C++](../about/cplusplus.html)
    -   headlong rushes to reduce language research to formal semantics and
        type theory
    -   humourless mathematicians, power-tripping academics, and other lost
        souls
    -   pedlars of profundity (Penrose, Wolfram, Hofstadter...)
