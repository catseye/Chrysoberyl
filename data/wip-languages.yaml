Robin:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Production language
  paradigms:
  - Functional
  description: |
    Robin is a language drawing from [[Pixley]], [[Erlang]], and PicoLisp.
    One distinctive feature of it is that it has an extremely small core semantics,
    to the point where even [[Closure|closures]] are defined in terms of macros.
    Another distinctive feature is that it is heavily resource-oriented; almost
    everything, including concurrent processes, is (or should be) a virtual device
    which must be acquired from a central resource arbiter.  This arbiter may
    satisfy the constraints you specify when requesting a device any way it sees
    fit; so the operating environment has potentially a lot of influence over
    exactly what your program does.
