Robin:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Production language
  paradigms:
  - Functional
  description: |
    Robin is a language drawing from [[Pixley]], [[Erlang]], and PicoLisp.
    One distinctive feature of it is that it has an extremely small core semantics,
    to the point where even [[Closure|closures]] are defined in terms of macros.
    Another distinctive feature is that it is heavily resource-oriented; almost
    everything, including concurrent processes, is (or should be) a virtual device
    which must be acquired from a central resource arbiter.  This arbiter may
    satisfy the constraints you specify when requesting a device any way it sees
    fit; so the operating environment has potentially a lot of influence over
    exactly what your program does.

Castile:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  paradigms:
  - Imperative
  - Functional
  description: |
    Castile is an unremarkable programming language which exists mainly
    because an unremarkable evaluator/compiler for it was written.  It is
    a bit like [[ANSI C]] except with proper union types (and no typecasts.)  Local
    variables are mutable, but arguments and globals aren't.  The compiler
    supports several backends, including [[Javascript]] and [[Ruby]].

  description: |
    Tamsin is an oddball little language that can't decide if it's a
    meta-language, a programming language, or a [[Perl|rubbish lister]].
    Its primary goal is to allow the rapid development of parsers,
    static analyzers, interpreters, and compilers, and to allow them
    to be expressed *compactly*.

Zame:

  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  paradigms:
  # kind of...
  - Maze-space-rewriting
  variant-of: Etcha
  description: |
    Zame is an automaton which uses the solution of a maze to
    generate an [[Etcha]] program which draws a new maze, then
    the process repeats.  An open question is to find a maze for which
    this process repeats indefinitely.
    
    Information on this language is only available on the Esowiki for now.
