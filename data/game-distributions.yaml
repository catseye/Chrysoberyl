  title: Bubble Escape
  summary: The tiny C64 video game <i>Bubble Escape 2K</i>
  byline: Designed and implemented by Chris Pressey
  abstract: |-
    <p>A video game I wrote for the Commodore 64 where you must
        guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  Was originally written
        in BASIC by a young me in the 80's.  Was rewritten in 6502 assembly
        language by a middle-aged me in the late oughts.  Was pared down so
        that (crunched) it fit into 2K, and was submitted to the
        <em>Mini Game Competition 2009</em>
        where (surprisingly, to me!) it got first place in its class.</p>
        <p>This distribution contains the original version, binaries and
        source code for the 2K version, and an 8K cartridge version.</p>

    <p>Zzrk is a toy text adventure game written in &quot;100% pure Zz&quot; â€” assuming such
    a concept even makes sense, given that Zz is a dynamic meta-language that might be
    better described as a self-modifying grammar.</p>
