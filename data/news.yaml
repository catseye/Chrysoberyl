    Is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catseye_tc) your thing?
  description: |
    It is definitely not my thing.
    
    But I recognize that it might be your thing, and that you might find it
    convenient to receive updates about Cat's Eye Technologies, via Twitter.
    
    I mean, on a technical level, there's no reason it shouldn't serve as a
    good platform for announcements and updates.  It's not my fault that
    that's not how most people use it.
    
    Thus, I will grit my teeth and bear it.
    
    Here, follow your little hearts out:
    
    ### [@catseye_tc](https://twitter.com/catseye_tc) ###
    
    *Content you can expect*:
    
    *   announcements of new things at Cat's Eye Technologies, **yes**;
    *   highlighting interesting esolangs, computational art,
        conceptual art, and related stuff out there, **yes**;
    *   every single brainfart I have, **no**;
    *   retweets of every clever thing that passes through my feed, **no**.
    
    *Frequency you can expect*: We're aiming for 1 tweet per day.
    Rarely will you ever see more than 2 tweets in the space of 12 hours.

"Wierd (one of 'em) is now installed online":
  type: Article
  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Mon, 09 Feb 2015 12:44:58 GMT
  blurb: |
    [[Wierd]] ([[Wierd (John Colagioia)|one of 'em]], anyway) is now
    [[installation/Wierd (John Colagioia)|installed online]].
  description: |
    So back in the mists of time — by which I mean the late 90's — there was this three-way
    email conversation between me, [[Ben Olmstead]], and [[John Colagioia]], right?
    
    And in it, we collectively sketched a fungeoid language which combined elements of
    [[Befunge-93]] with elements of [[brainfuck]] and added an original element — it's the
    bends in the chain of symbols, rather than the symbols themselves, that determine
    which instructions are executed.
    
    And now, a new page has been added to this language's
    [long and fuzzy history](https://github.com/catseye/Wierd/blob/master/README.markdown):
    it, or rather, [[Wierd (John Colagioia)|one of the extant dialects of it]],
    has been implemented in [[Javascript]] and [[HTML5]] with [[yoob.js]] and installed online
    here:
    
    *  [[installation/Wierd (John Colagioia)]]
    
    This may be the first implementation of (any) Wierd in a web browser.  Or it may not;
    searching the web for "wierd javascript" doesn't return as many results as you might
    think (as, apparently, a lot of people think Javascript is pretty weird, and have a
    propensity to mis-spell the word "weird".)
    
    I would like to implement [[Wierd (Milo van Handel)|the other extant dialect]], too,
    some day.  But not today.

    Whether you get out the joss sticks and put Ravi Shankar on the stereo

    [[installation/Canvas Feedback]].
    
    It all started while discussing the 1970's-era Doctor Who title sequence
    and the video art of [[Nam June Paik]].  The digital era has made many
    of those analogue techniques less accessible — so, even if we can't bring
    them back, why not see what it's like if we try to adapt them for the
    modern world of web browsers and graphics cards?

The Aftermath of NaNoGenMo 2014:

  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Thu, 18 Dec 2014 20:58:20 GMT
  blurb: |
    The Aftermath of [[NaNoGenMo 2014]].
  description: |
    So [[NaNoGenMo 2013|NaNoGenMo]] survived into a [[NaNoGenMo 2014|second year]].
    
    It probably would have made more sense to mention it at the beginning
    of November, rather than two-thirds through December, but — well —
    it's all very exciting when its time of year comes around you see,
    and I get distracted.  Last year, I didn't bother to say anything about
    it even _after_ it was over.  So this is, at least, an improvement over that.
    
    In 2014, Cat's Eye Technologies (or rather, Chris Pressey sponsored by
    the auspices of Cat's Eye Technologies — or something) staffed the
    [NaNoGenLab](https://github.com/catseye/NaNoGenLab/tree/nanogenmo-2014-end),
    running one experiment in the generation, transformation, and general
    mutilation of text, per day, for the month of November.  (So that was a
    goal of: 30 experiments.  But we actually ended up with 32, somehow.)
    
    Out of this chaos, we generated some novels too, which you can read
    in the [[Text]]s section.
    
    And I regret with alarm to note that, right in the middle of November, there was
    an unfortunate...
    [aesthetic incident](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/10#issuecomment-63069185)...
    which resulted in... _measures_ being taken, you see...
    resulting in the creation of
    [this monstrosity](https://github.com/cpressey/NaOpGenMo/).  Listen
    at your own risk.
       
    Oh!  And, um, I dusted off some [[Gewgaw|gewgaws]] that were just languishing
    in the lab, and put them on the site.  They are, in no particular order,
    [[installation/The Judgment of Paris]],
    [[installation/Woman on Film]],
    [[installation/Radialjective]], and
    [[installation/Circus Xamulus]].
    
    And also [[installation/Cheshire Text]], which is not a gewgaw but a text, but which
    was not done for NaNoGenMo, because it's not a novel.  And a
    [[installation/Text Uniquifier]], which isn't a novel _or_ a text but
    which _was_ done for NaNoGenMo because it's a generator, or at least a
    filter, which I've classified, provisionally, as a gewgaw.  Clear as mud, eh?

"Introducing The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform":
  type: Article
  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Sat, 04 Oct 2014 18:49:59 GMT
  blurb: |
    The première of
    [The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform](https://github.com/catseye/The-Platform).
  description: |
    We are happy to announce the first release of
    [[The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform]],
    version 0.1.  It is a "distro" (if I may use that "word") of
    [NetBSD 6.1.4](http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-6/NetBSD-6.1.4.html),
    containing almost all of Cat's Eye Technologies' software distributions and
    the infrastructure needed to build and run them.
    
    Each of the software distributions is tagged at a particular version
    (The Platform v0.1 can be thought of as a "versionset") at which they
    build and run on NetBSD, and if they have automated tests, the relevant
    ones pass.
    
    There is no binary distribution yet, so if you want a copy of
    The Platform, you'll have to build it yourself (instructions for doing
    so are included.)  However, we hope to distribute a binary image once we
    sort out how best to host large files.
    
    It is, in a sense, an exercise in "software canning" to diminish bitrot.
    As long as you have an i386 emulator (such as [[QEMU]]) which can boot
    into NetBSD, you will be able to use these software distributions, without
    having to worry about conflicts due to upgrades and suchlike.
    
    And as an exercise, it was somewhat illuminating; almost all of our
    projects, excluding what's hosted [[Online Installation|online]], can
    be run on a rather modest environment of open-source infrastructure:
    NetBSD (which already contains Lua and `gcc`), GNU Make, cPython, Perl,
    Erlang/OTP (stripped down), Hugs98, Chicken Scheme, yasm, and Ophis.


'BefOS version 0.10 released and installed online':

  blurb: |
    [[BefOS]] version 0.10 released and [[installation/BefOS|installed online]].
  description: |
    Look!  Up on [[installation/BefOS|this web page!]]  Is it [[Befunge-93|Befunge]]?
    Is it an [[operating system]]?  No... no, it's just a disk sector editor
    with some unusual features, really.
    
    Er... in case you were wondering... yes, this *is* the time of the
    year (September) when I usually do something to celebrate the anniversary
    of [[Befunge-93]].  It's 21 years old now, so if it were a person, it
    could drink legally in the United States, and, basically, it would be
    tried as an adult in pretty much any court in the world.
    
    BefOS is a bit younger (but it would still be old enough to, what,
    drive?), but, in answer to your unspoken question, no, updating BefOS was
    not what I was planning to do for Befunge-93's birthday.  It's only
    tangentially related.
    
    In fact, I've been working on cleaning up the Befunge-93 (and [[Maentwrog]]
    and [[RUBE]] reference distributions — making their implementations
    compile cleanly on multiple platforms ([[Linux]], [[NetBSD]], [[FreeDOS]],
    and [[AmigaDOS 1.3]].)
    
    But that's all not quite done yet; hopefully the Befunge-93 distribution
    will have a few more surprises in it before the end of the year.
    
    But before you bemoan the barbarity of Befunge's birthday bash being a
    bit belated, ... well, nothing really, I just wanted to get some
    alliteration out of my system there.  Have fun with [[installation/BefOS]].

    And it came to pass that my mind turned once again to the question
    of whether there are any universal computational classes smaller
    than the class of recursively enumerable functions.
    
    And lo, did I try to write a self-interpreter that was obviously
    not Turing-complete; and lo, did I fail.  Pretty sure I failed, yeah.
    
    But the result, behold!  It was less than half the size of [[Pixley]]'s
    meta-circular interpreter.  So did I keep it, and did I christen it
    [[Yolk]], and verily did I wax philosophical in its README about `cons`
    and stuff.

'Release of toolshelf version 0.1-2014.0823':
  type: Article
  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Sat, 23 Aug 2014 07:49:41 GMT
  blurb: |
    Release of [[toolshelf]] version 0.1-2014.0823.
  description: |
    Oh man, so many things updated recently, but this news feed is so
    not one of them.  OK, where to begin.  OK...
    
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]] really isn't in the business of making
    tools.  (Implementations of programming languages excepted —
    they're incidental, they're in service of the languages themselves.)
    
    But we've implemented so many programming languages that, without
    some kind of tooling, the situation would become unwieldy.  So, for
    example, we designed [[Falderal]] and build [[py-falderal]] so that
    all these programming languages could have their example programs
    presented nicely and tested in an automated way.
    
    But there have been other, more fundamental problems to solve.  How
    do you get all of these implementations onto a machine in the first
    place, for instance?  If the distribution is self-contained, that's
    not a huge problem — download it and maybe build it and run it.  But
    if it's not self-contained, if it has dependencies (and ultimately they
    all do, because each implementation is written *in* something,) then it
    becomes a package management problem.
    
    And I detest package managers.  I don't like their fragile package
    databases that get corrupted if you look at them wrong.  I don't
    like their tendency to shotgun files all over my filesystem; nor do I
    like having faith that, if asked to remove the package, they will find
    them all and delete them.  I don't like that they require root
    priviledges (*root priviledges!*) to install anything.  And I don't
    like that they're almost never portable; there's one for every operating
    system and one for every programming language and never mind the fact
    that every modern operating system hosts more than one programming language.
    
    So we wrote our own and called it [[toolshelf]].  **toolshelf is
    a package installer which neither uses packages, nor installs anything.**
    (Why yes, I am feeling a little farklempt, but that's neither here nor
    there.)  It doesn't maintain a package database, it keeps all its files
    in one place (which you can just blow away if you don't want it anymore),
    it doesn't need root priviledges, and it is quite portable (in theory,
    anyway.)
    
    It simply downloads (or clones) what you ask it to, makes its best guess
    at how to build it, and if that succeeds, makes its best guess at which
    files are executables and libraries that you care about, and puts those
    files on the appropriate search paths.  Voilà!  Sorted.
    
    Ah, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, that's insane.
    That's not a real package manager.  That's going to fail in *so* many cases.
    
    All true.  And all irrelevant.  In fact, it works in a surprising number
    of cases.  It's actually really good for random little projects you find
    on Github and elsewhere.  (It's not like they're ever going to show up
    in a "real" package manager.  And when you get bored with them, you just
    blow away the clone directory.)  And really, the other option is installing
    from source — and you can just think of toolshelf as an assistant that makes
    installing from source a lot less painful.
        
    More to the point, it works really well with our projects.  It is the
    recommended way to start using software from Cat's Eye Technologies.  Just
    [install toolshelf](https://github.com/catseye/toolshelf/#quick-start)
    and then
    
        toolshelf dock @@catseye
    
    and watch it download, build, and install everything.

    Even though it was originally only intended for random little projects, I
    now regularly dock things like [[QEMU]], Chicken Scheme, and Django with it.
    I recently set up two Linux environments for my own use; on each of them,
    I installed only maybe a dozen packages from `apt`, and I haven't used
    `pip` at all.  Most of what I've needed, I've brought in with toolshelf.
    
    Of course, there are still some rough edges — and the way it works, there
    will always *be* rough edges — but there is a lot of potential too.
    
    So, [[toolshelf|check it out]]!

    The [[Online Installation|Online Gallery]] has had an overhaul since
    the last time I announced anything regarding it.  It's got tabs with
    proper anchors and stuff now.
    
    In an attempt to prove that I am a polymath (which is a Greek word which means
    "bad at everything",) music I've written and pictures I've made
    and texts I've (meta-)written are available under the tabs there now.
    
    But its main purpose is still for interactive HTML5-y stuff, especially
    esolangs, and lo, there is
    [[installation/Wunnel|an HTML5 implementation of Wunnel]] there now too.
    
    And with this implementation of Wunnel, [[yoob.js]] has reached another
    release point, version 0.6.  But, of course, it is still basically in the
    work-in-progress stage, with things changing all over.

    [Github as a computer dating service](https://github.com/cpressey/Operation-Match-Github)
    (not that I can in good conscience recommend that.)
  description: |
    As a little hack on the weekend, I started playing with the Github API,
    after using it for more serious purposes in [[toolshelf]].  The result was
    
    [Operation Match, Github edition](https://github.com/cpressey/Operation-Match-Github)
    
    which turns Github into a computer dating service.  Well, not really,
    and I really *can't* recommend using Github for romance...
    
    ...but the script *does* try to find Github users who have tastes that
    are similar to those to a given user, based on the starred repositories
    they have in common.  And while it's very crude metric,
    I did end up finding a few users with it whose interests seem broadly
    similar to my own, who I have since started following.
    
    (And I suppose that it's a coincidence that
    just as I was about to write this announcement, 
    the BBC ran [this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26613909)?)

    perhaps, except without the wires.  I'll leave it to you to decide if this

    ![Pixley Interpreter as nested rectangles](http://catseye.tc/images/generated/Pixley.png)
    
    But that's not all!  We also present what happens when you run
    that one [[Etcha]] example program over and over again.  Looks a bit like
    a pattern produced by [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant),
    and perhaps that is no surprise at all.  You can try this, and any other
    Etcha program you care to concoct, yourself in [[installation/Etcha]].

'Release of yoob.js version 0.5':

  publication-date: Wed, 08 Jan 2014 19:19:33 GMT
  blurb: |
    [[yoob.js]] 0.5 has been released.
  description: |
    [[yoob.js]] has been mentioned in several announcements, but this is the
    first announcement concerning it specifically.  It started out as a
    project to replace [[yoob]], running esolangs in [[HTML5]] instead of a
    [[Java]] applet, but as of this release — version 0.5 — it has grown some
    generally-useful features for making animated and interactive things in
    HTML5, especially on the `<canvas>` element.
    
    All that notwithstanding, this is a fairly minor announcement for a
    fairly minor release.  The major version number is still at zero, and
    there will likely be a few backwards-incompatible changes in the next
    version.  But 0.5 has enough reasonably useful junk in it that it's a
    comfortable snapshot of things at this stage.

  description: |
    Version 1.2 of the [[Shelta]] distribution has been released.  This
    is a very minor update, with the only change to the language being
    essentially inconsequential: Shelta source files now must end with
    [everybody's favourite character](http://prog21.dadgum.com/76.html),
    the vertical tab, instead of a null byte.
    
    This was to work around what seems to be a subtle bug in [[FreeDOS]].
    And that, in turn, was to get Shelta running under FreeDOS inside the
    [[HTML5]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]] emulator, [[v86]].  You can
    read all the gory details [here](https://github.com/catseye/Shelta/blob/master/doc/fdos2013.txt).
    
    Anyway, this all brings us to the good news, which is: you can now

    This year — about two months ago, to be more exact — marked
    the 20th anniversary of [[Befunge-93]].  How to commemorate
    this historic occasion?  
    
    Well, one way would be to design its twenty-year successor,
    "Befunge-113".  But that's just _typical_, y'know?  Besides,
    I doubt there's much left to be done with Befunge besides
    suck all the fun out of it by defining it more formally.
    At any rate, I don't think any Befunge-113 I could come up
    with at the moment would make very many people happy, so:
    proposal declined.
    
    A better idea: make it easier to re-create the development
    environment in which Befunge-93 was originally developed.
    Namely, [[AmigaDOS 1.3]] on an [[Amiga 500]].
    
    So, that's what we did, and the result is [[Amiga Gondola]],
    a set of shell scripts which, given an [[E-UAE]] emulator,
    images of the Workbench and Extras disks, and access to
    Aminet, put together an environment which, while not being
    a totally authentic copy of the environment I was using
    twenty years ago, is a perfectly cromulent development
    environment for AmigaDOS 1.3.
    
    More information about Amiga Gondola and some nice screenshots
    can be found in its
    [README](https://github.com/catseye/Amiga-Gondola/blob/master/README.markdown).

'Release of Falderal version 0.9 "Navy Pier"':

  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Tue, 29 Oct 2013 20:22:36 GMT
  blurb: |
    [[Falderal]] version 0.9 "Navy Pier" has been released.
  description: |
    Well, that was quick — well, we were on a roll (whoa, déjà vu.)
    [[Falderal]] 0.9 introduces one major new feature —
    the ability to supply input to a test.  Typically, the test body
    would be considered the program (in some language) being tested,
    and the input would be sent to the standard input of the language
    interpreter (or whatever) to ensure that that program reacts the
    way you expect it to, given that input.
    
    There are also a number of cleanups and minor improvements in
    `py-falderal`, including warning you if there are no tests to
    be run, or if it has run the same tests multiple times.  It will
    also produce partial test results if you break it with `^C` in
    the middle of a long test run.

'Release of Falderal version 0.8 "Ukrainian Village"':

  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Sat, 26 Oct 2013 18:45:30 GMT
  blurb: |
    [[Falderal]] version 0.8 "Ukrainian Village" has been released.
  description: |
    A "new" version of [[Falderal]], version 0.8 "Ukrainian Village", has
    been released.
    
    I say "new" because, well, it's basically the same as it's been for the
    last year, when the `Test.Falderal` implementation of Falderal in
    [[Haskell]] was replaced by the `py-falderal` implementation in
    [[Python]], which was christened the new reference implementation.
    
    This switcheroo happened right after the last distribution of Falderal
    in which `Test.Falderal` was the reference implementation,
    version 0.7 "Odgen Avenue", was released.  Unfortunately, I see by
    my records that I never announced that in this news feed, so, this
    may be news to you.  Yes, it's written in Python now.  And much like
    version 0.7 was a release of Falderal to get it out of the way so I
    could start working on a brand new code base (in Python), version 0.8
    is a release to get this relatively-stable Python version out of the way
    so I can start making larger, long-overdue improvements to it.
    
    The Falderal Literate Test Format has not changed much between 0.7
    and 0.8.  The main change is now that blocks *must* be indented by
    four spaces.  It is generally assumed that Falderal test files will be
    embedded in Markdown and have file extensions like `.markdown`
    that let software (e.g. Github and Bitbucket) know how to pretty-format
    them.
    
    In related news, recent improvements to [[toolshelf]] allow it to
    run any tests defined in a source tree, and to operate on all source
    trees owned by a given user on a given host.  The end result being
    that we can now say `toolshelf test bitbucket.org/catseye/all` and
    have it test *all* of Cat's Eye Technologies' active distributions.
    And the even better news is that, out of approximately 112 distributions,
    22 have tests (mostly done with Falderal), and all 22 of those currently
    pass on both Ubuntu and Windows (under Cygwin).

"New implementations of Xoomonk and Pixley":
  type: Article
  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Thu, 24 Oct 2013 19:42:47 GMT
  blurb: |
    Xoomonk 1.0 and Pixley 2.0-2013.1024 have been released, each with new
    implementations.
  description: |
    [[Xoomonk]] 1.0 was recently released.  For this release, a Xoomonk
    interpreter was implemented in [[Python]], using the [[Falderal]] tests
    written for the *test-driven language design* approach used in Xoomonk
    0.1's documentation.  I've used test-driven language design successfully
    in other projects ([[Castile]], [[Robin]]) since Xoomonk was released, but
    it was the first project in which I proposed the concept, so it's nice to
    see it finally realized there.
    
    The semantics of Xoomonk 1.0 are slightly simpler than those set out for
    Xoomonk 0.1 — specifically, a variable is considered unsaturated in a block
    if it is *never* assigned a value in that block (and not just if it is
    used in the block before it is assigned a value.)  The syntax for built-ins
    also changed slightly.  But these are not major changes, and the same
    original mouthfeel of malingering updateable stores is still there (and
    implemented!)
    
    [[Pixley]] 2.0-2013.1024 has also been released.  There are no changes to
    the language in this release, but two new implementations, [[mignon]],
    in [[ANSI C]], and [[haney]], in [[Haskell]], have been added to the
    reference distribution.  They both implement Pixley well enough to serve
    as the bottom of a tower of Pixley interpreters.  Many of the supporting
    materials (scripts, tests) have also been cleaned up.

  description: |
    Two new HTML5 gewgaws in the [[Online Installation|Gallery]]:
    [[installation/Chzrxl]] and [[installation/Multicolouralism]].
    
    Also, the public-domain gewgaws are now kept in
    [a repository on Github](https://github.com/catseye/HTML5-Gewgaws)
    with
    [a mirror on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/catseye/html5-gewgaws).
    
    Also, the esolang [[installation/ZOWIE]] is now runnable online.
    Unlike previous online esolang implementations, this one didn't involve
    re-implementing ZOWIE in [[Javascript]].  Instead, the ZOWIE reference
    interpreter, written in [[Python]], is running under [[Skulpt]] on that
    web page.  Only a few modifications were necessary, and it's only a
    little pokey.
    
    Oh, also!  The [[Programming Language]] index has been redone to be a
    bit more like the [[Project Matrix]].  It's a bit daunting, and awkward
    still, but probably better than how it was organized previously.

    [[catseye.tc]] is now hosted on new web servers.
  description: |
    "Here's a nickel, kid.  Get a real web hosting service."
    
    So I did.
    
    You should see few if any changes.  The ones you might see are:
    
    *   `www.catseye.tc` is no longer an alias for `catseye.tc`, although
        I'll probably set up a redirect in the near future, maybe, if I
        get around to it.
    *   Getting documentation (of esolangs, etc.) onto `catseye.tc` has
        always been a bit of a pain, and that fact hasn't changed, so only
        links to documentation on Github are given here for now.
    *   On the plus side, URLs for Chrysoberyl nodes now look much nicer;
        you can use underscores instead of spaces, kind of like what
        Mediawiki does.  The old URLs will still work too, though.
    *   The new servers are in Europe.  That may affect your latency.
    
    Everything else should be pretty much as it was.  If you see anything
    really broken, feel free to let me know.

    Several new [[HTML5]] gewgaws are now online in

  description: |
    In [[Programming Languages as an Artistic Medium|a previous article]],
    I mentioned that I consider, not just
    [[Programming Language|programming languages]], but also [[HTML5]],
    an artistic medium.
    
    If short, fluffy, entertaining pieces of music are called
    [bagatelles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagatelle_%28music%29),
    then I propose that short fluffy works in the medium of HTML5 be
    called [gewgaws](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gewgaw).  Or at
    least, that's what I call them.
            
    And so, here are a few HTML5 gewgaws for your (possible) entertainment.
    Located in the Digital Art Exhibit of our
    [[Online Installation|Gallery]].  In fact there are six new ones in
    total.  And when I say HTML5, I mainly mean the `<canvas>` stuff, of
    course.
    
    They're not esolangs, but if you like esolangs, or if you liked
    [[Cyclobots]], you might like some of the more mathematically-oriented
    ones.

"An Online Parade of Cellular Automata":

  article-type: announcement
  publication-date: Sat, 06 Apr 2013 12:08:26 GMT
  blurb: |
    Our five [[ALPACA]] creations are now online in
    the [[Online Installation|Gallery]].
  description: |
    It's about time!  You can now play with Cat's Eye Technologies'
    cellular automata in your web browser on the following pages:
    [[installation/REDGREEN]], [[installation/Circute]], [[installation/Braktif]],
    [[installation/Jaccia]], and [[installation/Jacciata]].
    
    I've wanted to be able to generate some kind of usable-in-a-web-browser
    code from [[ALPACA]] descriptions for a good long while.  At one point
    I even considered hacking [[alpaca.pl]] to generate [[yoob]] classes
    to do it.  Well, the ALPACA language got a long-deserved update, and
    [[Perl]] gave way to [[Python]] for the new compiler; and yoob in
    [[Java]] has given way to [[yoob.js]] in [[Javascript]].
    
    (In fact, there's nothing much HTML5-specific about these Javascript
    implementations, except for a slider control for adjusting the animation
    speed, which is kind of crude and subject to change anyway.)
    
    The few improvements to yoob.js that were spurred on by this effort to
    get these CA's online have also resulted in improvements to the
    online installations of [[installation/Gemooy]] and
    [[installation/noit o' mnain worb]].

"noit o' mnain worb implemented in HTML5":

    [[installation/noit o' mnain worb|HTML5]].
  description: |
    The implementation of various things in HTML5 continues.  This
    time it's [[noit o' mnain worb]], which you can play with
    [[installation/noit o' mnain worb|here]].  With pretty graphics,
    for some value of pretty.
    
    Seeing as worb has already been implemented in [[yoob]], why
    do this?  It's not like I can say it's "now playable online", because
    it already was.  (Or if not "playable", then... "play withable"...
    or whatever.)
    
    Well, the security track record for Java applets has been
    rather awful lately.  Certainly, applets aren't going away, but they're
    quickly falling out of fashion.  Updating your browser may,
    reasonably, disable Java.  We may one day, not far off, see the JVM
    stop being shipped with browsers, and available only as an add-on.
    
    And that all means I have to tell you to install and/or enable Java in
    your browser, which defeats the idea of reducing the install burden for
    esolangs, which was one of the original goals of yoob.
    
    The newer [[yoob.js]] framework, which uses [[HTML5]] instead of Java,
    is still pretty messy and ad-hoc, and lacks
    a few things that would be nice to have, like adjustable animation
    speed.  But the more things, like this, that get implemented in it, the
    more it will mature.

  blurb: |
    Oops, I just turned [[Chrysoberyl]] into a blogging platform.
  description: |
    I'm not much of a blogger.  I've considered starting a blog a few times,
    but the thing is, most blogs are either about trends or opinions
    (or both, combined: _reactions_), and I don't follow trends, and when I
    have opinions, they're about specific *things*.  (Which is why the old
    [[catseye.tc]] had an "About" section, and why [[Chrysoberyl]] lets
    commentary be attached to particular nodes.)  And those opinions, like
    the things themselves, are relatively "evergreen" -- they're not news,
    there's no need to go announcing them.  I also like to be able to
    edit/tweak/update an opinion incrementally after writing it, which also
    fits poorly with the blog model.  [EDIT: see what I mean?]
    
    At the same time, I do generate news, if not trends, and these
    announcements that I've implemented such-and-such or updated
    such-and-such *are* news articles, even if they're short ones.
    
    And sometimes I have something to say that's not focussed on a single
    topic, and it fits best as a stand-alone article, such as 
    [[Retrospective: Chris Pressey on Language Design|my retrospective on esolang design]].
    
    Therefore, I merged the concepts of "News Item" and "Article" into
    just [[Article]] in Chrysoberyl, and all articles get included in
    the Atom feed, whether they're explicitly "news" or not.  The result
    is that Chrysoberyl is, among all the other words that already don't
    describe it, now a blogging platform.
    
    That's not to say you'll be seeing a lot of blog posts in the news feed.
    Even this article, which I consciously tried to write like a blog post,
    is still really mostly an announcement.
    
    But you might see some.  You totally might.  Yeah, you're totally going
    to hear every little nitpick I have about why the latest version of
    Gadget X (resp. Language X) sucks and why GadgetCorp (resp. the Language
    X community) is going totally off-course as a company (resp. open-source
    project).  Because that's so totally the kind of thing I give a crap
    about.

"ALPACA turns 1.0":

  description: |
    We have finally released version 1.0 of [[ALPACA]],
    A Language for the Pithy Articulation of Cellular Automata.
    
    The specification has been rewritten (although _written_ would be
    more accurate) from scratch, and adds some new features to the language,
    such as being able to include an initial configuration in an ALPACA
    description, and handling neighbourhoods other than the Moore
    neighbourhood.
    
    The reference implementation has also been rewritten from scratch,
    in [[Python]] this time.  It can both interpret an ALPACA description,
    and compile it to [[Javascript]].  We plan to use the latter functionality
    to showcase some cellular automata on the website, which incidentally is
    looking a little less dire these days.
    
    The version bump also cures two unpleasantnesses which are pet peeves
    of mine: ALPACA is no longer hanging out at version 0 (which sets it
    apart from, say, `node.js`), and the meaningless version numbers like
    0.94 are now history.  (It's not like it was the ninety-fourth iteration
    of anything.)

    We have released [[Exanoke]], a pure functional

    recursive functions.
    
    If this doesn't sound like a stellar achievement, it's probably because
    it's not one.  But, I was previously aware of only how an imperative
    language could be restricted to primitive recursion (i.e. have only `for`
    loops) and previously did some work on analyzing functions in a
    pure functional language to determine if they are primitive recursive
    or not; in a way, Exanoke combines both of those ideas.

    that means in this day and age where it's not considered absurd for
    web services to be in perpetual beta.
    
    Well, concretely, what it means is we've replaced the older parts of
    `[[catseye.tc]]` entirely with Chrysoberyl entries, with a lot of web
    redirects so all those links out in the wild still work.
    
    What it doesn't mean is that Chrysoberyl is finished in any sense.
    Its content will of course continue to evolve, and it will likely be a
    while before we are entirely happy with its structure and styling (so
    expect these to change in the near future.)

    So yeah, let's catch up with all the exciting, exciting
    *non*-Chrysoberyl-related developments we've seen here in the past few days!
    
    First, please welcome our latest newcomer to the menagerie,
    [[Jolverine]].  I haven't been able to write a loop in it yet, but
    <a class="external" href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Talk:Jolverine">Ørjan
    is figuring that part out</a>.
    
    Second, I remembered why I designed [[Etcha]] — it was part of a
    larger, stranger, maze-based automaton called [[Zame]].  Which is now
    described on the esowiki.
    
    Third, I finally got around to implementing [[Thue]].  In [[Ruby]].
    I've been maintaining a distribution of it for so long without contributing
    to it, I felt it was overdue.  And now there is a new release of the
    Thue distribution.
    
    Fourth, Keymaker reported a bug with in [[smith.pl]] — and while fixing
    it, I found another fixed that one too, and there has been another release
    of the [[SMITH]] distribution.
    
    Lastly, while implementing a truth-machine in [[Ypsilax]] I found a bug
    in [[ypsilax.pl]] too (turns out, in [[Perl]], the *string* `'0'` is false-y.
    It's things like that why I don't code in Perl much anymore.)  So there's
    a new release of the [[Ypsilax]] distribution too.

    Remember "The Great DVCS Exodus"
    (May 20, 2012)?  (Well, if you don't, scroll down.)
    I am happy to say that it is, for all intents and purposes,
    complete: essentially all of our stuff is now in repositories on
    <a class="external" href="https://bitbucket.org/catseye">Bitbucket</a>
    and
    <a class="external" href="https://github.com/catseye">GitHub</a>.
    
    And remember how I said that the role of catseye.tc might
    change in light of this, but that I wasn't sure how?  Well, here's
    the deal.  We have put together a database of sorts of all the
    things Cat's Eye Technologies has produced, and many of the
    things directly related to the things Cat's Eye Technologies has
    produced, and how they all relate, called _Chrysoberyl_.
    
    I like to think of it as a sort of cross between a wiki and a semantic web
    and _The Devil's Dictionary_.
    It teases apart the relationships between programming languages
    (and other intangibles), implementations (things you can
    run), and distributions (things you can download), and casts it all in
    a bunch of YAML files with embedded Markdown.
    From these, a set of HTML5 pages can be generated, and lo and behold,
    [[Chrysoberyl|these are now on the site]].
    
    They are, however, still in a very early stage of development.  Expect
    the styling to change, the content to change, the structure to change,
    links to break, and the usual sort of thing.
    
    This has a few implications for the rest of the site.  The Gallery Space will
    stay more-or-less as it is for a while, but the Projects Space
    and the "About" documents will eventually go away, and will redirect into
    Chrysoberyl instead.  In the meantime, they will likely *not* be
    updated to reflect the latest developments.  Look at Chrysoberyl, or our repositories
    on Bitbucket and Github, instead, if you want to follow those.
    
    And, more importantly for you (if you are reading this from our RSS feed)
    is that our RSS feed *will no longer be updated*.  This will probably
    be the last item in it, except for an "Are you still reading this?" item when we've switched
    entirely over to Chrysoberyl.  Instead, you will want to subscribe to
    <a href="http://catseye.tc/feeds/atom_15_news.xml">our new Atom feed for
    news, generated from Chrysoberyl</a>.

    We have released a new programming language.
    It's called Cfluviurrh.  It was designed for writing programs that
    can *feel*.  That is, defines a mechanism by which
    a program can be instructed to experience particular emotions.
    You might, thus, on first blush, consider Cfluviurrh to be
    unimplementable, as modern-day computers are not capable of
    experiencing emotions (you guess.)  However, this is demonstrably
    untrue, and the Cfluviurrh reference interpreter demonstrates it.

    that packaging all reference materials for a language into a
    "reference distribution" is the way to go, the bef and befunge93
    distributions have been merged into a single, NEW distribution
    called "befunge-93".  Also included are a couple of new example
    programs, a Makefile, and a small feature fix to the debugger.  Enjoy!

    And when we do get rid of a language, we like
    to introduce another language to keep our numbers up.  Enter
    Velo, a vaguely Ruby-inspired scripting language which unifies
    strings with code blocks, and scripts with object classes.
    It's by no means final or complete, but enough of it is there that
    it feels like it's been "invented", so here it is — expect it to
    change in minor (but backwards-incompatible) ways in the
    future, though.

    It's not often we get rid of a language here at

    it happened today.  I decided, some time back, that the languages
    beta-Juliet and 2iota were simply too similar to be distinct
    languages; and so, 2iota was absorbed into β-Juliet version 2.0
    (which we can spell with the Greek letter now that everybody's
    got their Unicode boots on, right?)  The semantics of the language
    have also been clarified somewhat (although the reference
    interpreter still needs to catch up to them in some small ways.)

    doesn't exist, and a modest assortment of other things.  It
    graciously ignores statements that it doesn't know anything
    about, allowing it to be dialect-agnostic.  It has been used
    on our BASIC offerings (all two of them) and did, indeed, find
    [a useless jump in Apple Befunge](https://github.com/catseye/Apple-Befunge/commit/ba4319011ccbac2041f0a6a9ec5cadae91483906).

    Did you know that the catseye.tc website is statically
    generated with a set of XSLT templates?  Well, it's true.
    This has certain advantages — like, when was the last time you
    saw broken XHTML on one of the project pages?  But it has
    disadvantages, too.  Namely, it's becoming a pain to update.
    
    Meanwhile, we've been putting more and more of our
    projects under distributed version control.  We tend to use
    [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) but
    [hg-git](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgGit)
    provides a fairly seamless bridge to [git](http://git-scm.com/)
    repositories, too.  And then there's these sites that host such repositories
    for you, [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
    and [Github](https://github.com/) (among others).
    
    So, we've been neglecting catseye.tc a bit lately, and have been
    putting our projects onto Bitbucket
    and GitHub, and making updates to them there.  There are certain advantages
    to doing so.  For example, if you find a bug in one of our implementations,
    you can fork that project, fix the bug, and even if Chris doesn't respond to your
    pull request for three or four years, at least your fork will be out there and
    available to anyone
    else who might be interested.  On top of that, the source browsers on both
    of these sites are better than anything we have the time to invest in putting on
    this site.  (Besides, if we go the way of \_why, chances are some of
    our projects will end up there anyway, so why not give them a head start?)
    
    But no, this does not mean the end of catseye.tc.  I mean, we have
    to keep it, or all our Java package hierarchies will be busted, right?  And I think
    people are peeved enough over all the old links that are still around that lead
    to all the old domain names Cat's Eye Technologies has used in the past — no
    sense putting another one on that heap, if we can help it.  But the role of
    catseye.tc might change somewhat.  I don't know yet.  We'll see.
    
    Anyway, the point is: keep watching this space, but if you want
    breaking updates on what kind of crazy crap we're working on
    *this minute*, check out

    Falderal, our format for unit-testing little

    As you can see, we have adopted a naming convention for
    release milestones — they're named after Chicagoland
    neigbourhoods, suburbs, landmarks, and institutions.
    This version was named after The Loop in recognition of its
    ability to shuttle test results between `falderal`
    and the various results generators implemented in different languages
    (Haskell, Bourne shell scripts) and to report on all the failures in
    a consistent way.

    unique symbols in 672 cons cells.  The distribution now also includes
    driver shell scripts, Falderal tests, and a P-Normalizer, probably the
    first non-trivial Pixley program to be written outside the Pixley interpreter
    itself.

    One thing I've wanted to do for a long while is
    design a language in which one can state proofs of the properties
    of programs in that language.  Not a full-blown theorem prover, just
    a proof checker, where you have to supply the proof, and the
    system tells you if it holds or doesn't hold.  And not an immensely
    powerful proof-checker either, just powerful enough to state some
    simple proofs which hold over an infinite universe of values.
    
    Well, after much thought and sketching, I have come up with
    a term-rewriting-based proof-checking language called Madison.  It
    supports both direct proof and proof by structural induction, and I
    have used it to write a proof that the reflection of the reflection
    of any binary tree is the same as the original tree.  It's not much,
    but I'm quite pleased with it.

    Well, that was quick — well,
    we were on a roll.  Falderal 0.4 introduces several
    desirable features.
    `Test.Falderal` is a Cabal package now, making
    installation easier, and this Cabal package installs
    a tool (unflinchingly called `falderal`)
    which drives the formatting and testing processes.
    Tests are now targetted at abstractions called
    _functionalities_, and
    functionalities are allowed to be implemented in different ways,
    including as shell commands, supporting the testing of multiple
    implementations of a function in multiple, essentially arbitrary
    implementation languages.  This all brings Falderal closer to
    its goal of being a testing framework for programming languages.

    Falderal 0.3.  Basically, two things happened.
    One, Falderal is a file format now, and
    `Test.Falderal`
    is the reference implementation,
    in Haskell, for tools which claim to understand the
    format.  Two, `Test.Falderal`
    is now able to format Falderal files into other formats.
    In fact, running tests is accomplished by formatting
    the Falderal file into Haskell code, and running that.

    we found in the stack routines that highly deserved
    being killed, so, we sure did that thing too.

    The yoob framework for esolang
    implementations has seen many minor improvements,
    and has had three more esolangs implemented for it.
    Two of these, Befunge-93 and brainfuck, are languages
    that no mega-eso-interpreter should be without; the
    third is Ypsilax, which was implemented in a relatively
    efficient manner (far more so than the existing implementation)
    to vet yoob's pattern-matching support.
    
    None of these esolang implementations is
    particularly refined; each has some shortcomings w.r.t.
    the framework, and probably some bugs too.  I expect
    they'll ripen with age.  Enjoy...

    The Befunge-93 reference interpreter,
    after a long period of inactivity, has been updated to
    version 2.22.  This fixes three bugs, shortcomings,
    features, call them what you will: EOF characters are
    no longer written into the playfield when loading an
    otherwise blank source file (thanks to whoever sent
    me that patch six-odd years ago, and sorry that I have
    no recollection who you are); long source file lines
    are truncated instead of wrapping around to the next
    playfield line (this lets bef load mycology.b98 correctly);
    and the # instruction now behaves consistently when
    combined with wrapping (i.e. when it occurs at the
    very edge of the playfield.)  All this and some minor
    aesthetic improvements to the interpreter, too!

    Cat's Eye Technologies has embarked
    on an ambitious project: build a framework which both
    reduces the effort to implement esolangs, and makes
    those implementations easily accessible to, and usable
    by, anyone with a modern web browser — even
    non-programmers.
    
    The project is called yoob.  Even though it
    is still in an early stage of development, already
    more than ten esolangs have been implemented in it.
    And you can certainly expect more in the future.

    They're not in our project space yet, but they are on the

    implementation already, thanks to Marinus.
    
    So, take a gander at 'em, and you'll be saying,

    Burro 2.0 fixes the design of the language to avoid the
    problem.  It is defined as an executable semantics written in
    Literate Haskell/Markdown which includes both a proof that Burro
    2.0 programs form a group, and a demonstration of how one can

    We have, until recently, hosted these in our projects space.
    However, because of the criteria listed in the first sentence,
    we decided that these aren't really "projects" in any good sense,
    and we resolved to establish a distinguished display case for
    these beauties on this website.
    
    And here it is – the Gallery of Esteemed Programming Languages.
    
    The past few days have also seen a flurry of extremely

    This may seem like a bit of a dodgy move, for a
    company with as staunch an attitude of post-modernist rectitude
    as Cat's Eye Technologies
    to go adopting technologies that are clearly of Pakled origin.
    
    However, there are several good reasons.  Firstly, XSLT, being
    a Turing-complete macro-expansion language with all the readability
    of Scheme, is practically an honourary esolang.  Secondly, RSS is
    specified about as rigorously and consistently as most esolangs as well.
    And thirdly — although I dispute that this is a particularly important

    Noticing that the Perl 5 implementation of [[HUNTER]]
    required a module that was never restored to the website after the last crash,
    I dug it out of cold storage and refurbished it a bit, resulting in
    [[Console::Virtual]].
    
    In the process I tidied up the HUNTER project quite a bit, including supporting a
    real delay, measured in milliseconds, between animation frames.  (This requires the
    Time::HiRes module, but it still works without it; you just can't get
    sub-second resolution in that case.)
    
    And, in the process of doing that, I noticed the implementation of
    [[noit o' mnain worb]] could use many of the same improvements.
    So now it, too, uses Console::Virtual
    instead of requiring an ANSI-compatible terminal, and supports an adjustable delay
    between frames.
    
    Concurrent with this project interdependency, I've made a quick stab at listing
    the requirements for each project in the little "info box" on its project page.
    This is pretty crude right now, but it's hopefully a step in the right direction.

    whose programs form an algebraical group under the operation of concatenation (roughly
    speaking — see the docs for the complete picture.)

    The Maentwrong language, predecessor of
    [[Befunge-93]], and thought by me to be lost forever (again), was found (again)
    on a long-forgotten backup disc.  It has been brought forth into the light
    of the projects directory (again) for whatever it's worth.
    
"catseye.mine.nu No Longer in Service":

    The catseye.mine.nu server is no longer in service
    This has two consequences:  The old http://catseye.mine.nu:8080/
    URL prefix for this site will no longer redirect here to catseye.tc,
    and the Subversion repositories served by catseye.mine.nu
    will no longer be publicly available.
    
    The catseye.webhop.net redirect will continue to work, and the
    tarball releases of projects will still be available from catseye.tc.
    
    Whether the catseye.mine.nu server will ever go up again or not depends
    on too many factors for me to be able to say at this time.  I definately want to
    keep providing publicly available source code repositories of the projects, but due
    to circumstances it will have to be a low priority goal over the next few months.
    
"Updates to SMITH and REDGREEN":

  description: |
    The SMITH language has been updated in
    a tiny but significant way: overwriting instructions with other instructions
    is now defined.  The reference implementation now implements this sanely as
    well.  Thanks to Nathan Thern for pointing this out (and for submitting a
    SMITH version of "99 Bottles of Beer"!)
    
    Some bugs in [[REDGREEN]] have been fixed
    as well: the documentation claims that Wires and Sparks behave per the
    WireWorld automaton, and that Zappy and BigZappy set things on fire.  The
    ALPACA implementation of REDGREEN now properly implements these rules.
    Thanks to Stewart Gordon for pointing these bugs out.
    
    Also, I dug up [[noise]] and put
    it in the projects.  I swear there was a manual page for it too, but I can't find it.

    The Hev programming language has been released.
    Hev allows programming in infix notation, but at the same time,
    never needs parentheses and never forces you to memorize precedence tables!
    Truly, a major breakthrough.

  description: |
    Most significantly, a project has been added for
    Zzrk, a text adventure
    game written in a meta-language intended for building compilers (Zz).
    
    I also brought [[GraNoLa/M]] and [[SP_ASM|SP\ASM]]
    out of those dusty ol' boxes in the attic and added them to the line-up.
    
    [[REDGREEN]], [[Braktif]], and [[Circute]]
    have also been split off from the main [[ALPACA]]
    distribution, and live in projects of their own.
    
    I also polished the site design a wee bit.
