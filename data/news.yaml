  description: |
    August 26, 2012:  We have released a new programming language.
    It's called Cfluviurrh.  It was designed for writing programs that
    can *feel*.  That is, defines a mechanism by which
    a program can be instructed to experience particular emotions.
    You might, thus, on first blush, consider Cfluviurrh to be
    unimplementable, as modern-day computers are not capable of
    experiencing emotions (you guess.)  However, this is demonstrably
    untrue, and the Cfluviurrh reference interpreter demonstrates it.

    been calling it that, and since we've decided more or less
    that packaging all reference materials for a language into a
    "reference distribution" is the way to go, the bef and befunge93
    distributions have been merged into a single, NEW distribution
    called "befunge-93".  Also included are a couple of new example
    programs, a Makefile, and a small feature fix to the debugger.  Enjoy!

    July 14, 2012:  And when we do get rid of a language, we like
    to introduce another language to keep our numbers up.  Enter
    Velo, a vaguely Ruby-inspired scripting language which unifies
    strings with code blocks, and scripts with object classes.
    It's by no means final or complete, but enough of it is there that
    it feels like it's been "invented", so here it is — expect it to
    change in minor (but backwards-incompatible) ways in the
    future, though.

    July 14, 2012:  It's not often we get rid of a language here at
    Cat's Eye Technologies, but it happens occasionally.  In fact,
    it happened today.  I decided, some time back, that the languages
    beta-Juliet and 2iota were simply too similar to be distinct
    languages; and so, 2iota was absorbed into β-Juliet version 2.0
    (which we can spell with the Greek letter now that everybody's
    got their Unicode boots on, right?)  The semantics of the language
    have also been clarified somewhat (although the reference
    interpreter still needs to catch up to them in some small ways.)

    BASIC programs.  `yucca` can find those
    places in your program where you jump to a line number that
    doesn't exist, and a modest assortment of other things.  It
    graciously ignores statements that it doesn't know anything
    about, allowing it to be dialect-agnostic.  It has been used
    on our BASIC offerings (all two of them) and did, indeed, find
    [a useless jump in Apple Befunge](https://github.com/catseye/Apple-Befunge/commit/ba4319011ccbac2041f0a6a9ec5cadae91483906).

  description: |
    May 20, 2012: Did you know that the catseye.tc website is statically
    generated with a set of XSLT templates?  Well, it's true.
    This has certain advantages — like, when was the last time you
    saw broken XHTML on one of the project pages?  But it has
    disadvantages, too.  Namely, it's becoming a pain to update.
    
    Meanwhile, we've been putting more and more of our
    projects under distributed version control.  We tend to use
    [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) but
    [hg-git](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgGit)
    provides a fairly seamless bridge to [git](http://git-scm.com/)
    repositories, too.  And then there's these sites that host such repositories
    for you, [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
    and [Github](https://github.com/) (among others).
    
    So, we've been neglecting catseye.tc a bit lately, and have been
    putting our projects onto Bitbucket
    and GitHub, and making updates to them there.  There are certain advantages
    to doing so.  For example, if you find a bug in one of our implementations,
    you can fork that project, fix the bug, and even if Chris doesn't respond to your
    pull request for three or four years, at least your fork will be out there and
    available to anyone
    else who might be interested.  On top of that, the source browsers on both
    of these sites are better than anything we have the time to invest in putting on
    this site.  (Besides, if we go the way of \_why, chances are some of
    our projects will end up there anyway, so why not give them a head start?)
    
    But no, this does not mean the end of catseye.tc.  I mean, we have
    to keep it, or all our Java package hierarchies will be busted, right?  And I think
    people are peeved enough over all the old links that are still around that lead
    to all the old domain names Cat's Eye Technologies has used in the past — no
    sense putting another one on that heap, if we can help it.  But the role of
    catseye.tc might change somewhat.  I don't know yet.  We'll see.
    
    Anyway, the point is: keep watching this space, but if you want
    breaking updates on what kind of crazy crap we're working on
    *this minute*, check out
    [Cat's Eye Technologies on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/catseye)

    functionality specifiers on the command line.  It also fixes
    several bugs and shortcomings in the previous version.

    December 14, 2011:  Falderal, our format for unit-testing little
    languages, has seen release of version 0.5 "The Loop".
    As you can see, we have adopted a naming convention for
    release milestones — they're named after Chicagoland
    neigbourhoods, suburbs, landmarks, and institutions.
    This version was named after The Loop in recognition of its
    ability to shuttle test results between `falderal`
    and the various results generators implemented in different languages
    (Haskell, Bourne shell scripts) and to report on all the failures in
    a consistent way.

    now somewhat simpler: 124 lines of Pixley, with 407 instances of 53
    unique symbols in 672 cons cells.  The distribution now also includes
    driver shell scripts, Falderal tests, and a P-Normalizer, probably the
    first non-trivial Pixley program to be written outside the Pixley interpreter
    itself.

  description: |
    December 2, 2011:  One thing I've wanted to do for a long while is
    design a language in which one can state proofs of the properties
    of programs in that language.  Not a full-blown theorem prover, just
    a proof checker, where you have to supply the proof, and the
    system tells you if it holds or doesn't hold.  And not an immensely
    powerful proof-checker either, just powerful enough to state some
    simple proofs which hold over an infinite universe of values.
    
    Well, after much thought and sketching, I have come up with
    a term-rewriting-based proof-checking language called Madison.  It
    supports both direct proof and proof by structural induction, and I
    have used it to write a proof that the reflection of the reflection
    of any binary tree is the same as the original tree.  It's not much,
    but I'm quite pleased with it.

    That means that Befunge is now old enough to drink in its native
    land of Canada.  To celebrate this, I thought I'd get Befunge-93 drunk
    to see what would happen.
    
    What happened was Flobnar, an esolang which is in many respects a
    functional dual of Befunge-93; most of the symbols have analogous

  description: |
    October 10, 2011:  Well, that was quick — well,
    we were on a roll.  Falderal 0.4 introduces several
    desirable features.
    `Test.Falderal` is a Cabal package now, making
    installation easier, and this Cabal package installs
    a tool (unflinchingly called `falderal`)
    which drives the formatting and testing processes.
    Tests are now targetted at abstractions called
    _functionalities_, and
    functionalities are allowed to be implemented in different ways,
    including as shell commands, supporting the testing of multiple
    implementations of a function in multiple, essentially arbitrary
    implementation languages.  This all brings Falderal closer to
    its goal of being a testing framework for programming languages.

    how Falderal works that we talked about when
    Falderal 0.2 was released?  Well, it's here, in
    Falderal 0.3.  Basically, two things happened.
    One, Falderal is a file format now, and
    `Test.Falderal`
    is the reference implementation,
    in Haskell, for tools which claim to understand the
    format.  Two, `Test.Falderal`
    is now able to format Falderal files into other formats.
    In fact, running tests is accomplished by formatting
    the Falderal file into Haskell code, and running that.

    we found in the stack routines that highly deserved
    being killed, so, we sure did that thing too.
    
    To celebrate — and to assuage our acquired annoyance at
    version numbers which look like decimal numbers that are supposed
    to indicate "close to release" — we have released version 1.0 of FBBI.

    ancient and venerable Maentwrog language that
    I decided I ought to update the distribution to
    include them -- along with a small fix that allows the
    source to be build with modern C compilers like
    gcc and pcc.

    March 30, 2011:  The yoob framework for esolang
    implementations has seen many minor improvements,
    and has had three more esolangs implemented for it.
    Two of these, Befunge-93 and brainfuck, are languages
    that no mega-eso-interpreter should be without; the
    third is Ypsilax, which was implemented in a relatively
    efficient manner (far more so than the existing implementation)
    to vet yoob's pattern-matching support.
    
    None of these esolang implementations is
    particularly refined; each has some shortcomings w.r.t.
    the framework, and probably some bugs too.  I expect
    they'll ripen with age.  Enjoy...

    March 18, 2011:  The Befunge-93 reference interpreter,
    after a long period of inactivity, has been updated to
    version 2.22.  This fixes three bugs, shortcomings,
    features, call them what you will: EOF characters are
    no longer written into the playfield when loading an
    otherwise blank source file (thanks to whoever sent
    me that patch six-odd years ago, and sorry that I have
    no recollection who you are); long source file lines
    are truncated instead of wrapping around to the next
    playfield line (this lets bef load mycology.b98 correctly);
    and the # instruction now behaves consistently when
    combined with wrapping (i.e. when it occurs at the
    very edge of the playfield.)  All this and some minor
    aesthetic improvements to the interpreter, too!

    March 15, 2011:  Cat's Eye Technologies has embarked
    on an ambitious project: build a framework which both
    reduces the effort to implement esolangs, and makes
    those implementations easily accessible to, and usable
    by, anyone with a modern web browser -- even
    non-programmers.
    
    The project is called yoob.  Even though it
    is still in an early stage of development, already
    more than ten esolangs have been implemented in it.
    And you can certainly expect more in the future.

    implementation already, thanks to Marinus.

    Burro 2.0 fixes the design of the language to avoid the
    problem.  It is defined as an executable semantics written in
    Literate Haskell/Markdown which includes both a proof that Burro

    This may seem like a bit of a dodgy move, for a
    company with as staunch an attitude of post-modernist rectitude
    as Cat's Eye Technologies
    to go adopting technologies that are clearly of Pakled origin.
    
    However, there are several good reasons.  Firstly, XSLT, being
    a Turing-complete macro-expansion language with all the readability
    of Scheme, is practically an honourary esolang.  Secondly, RSS is
    specified about as rigorously and consistently as most esolangs as well.
    And thirdly -- although I dispute that this is a particularly important
    reason -- somebody might actually find it useful.

  description: |
    November 23, 2007: Noticing that the Perl 5 implementation of [[Hunter|HUNTER]]
    required a module that was never restored to the website after the last crash,
    I dug it out of cold storage and refurbished it a bit, resulting in
    [[Console::Virtual]].
    
    In the process I tidied up the HUNTER project quite a bit, including supporting a
    real delay, measured in milliseconds, between animation frames.  (This requires the
    Time::HiRes module, but it still works without it; you just can't get
    sub-second resolution in that case.)
    
    And, in the process of doing that, I noticed the implementation of
    [[noit o' mnain worb]] could use many of the same improvements.
    So now it, too, uses Console::Virtual
    instead of requiring an ANSI-compatible terminal, and supports an adjustable delay
    between frames.
    
    Concurrent with this project interdependency, I've made a quick stab at listing
    the requirements for each project in the little "info box" on its project page.
    This is pretty crude right now, but it's hopefully a step in the right direction.

    November 5, 2007: The programming language You are Reading the Name of this Esolang
    was released.  It's an exploration in the design space of programming languages
    with undecidable elements.  Specifically, the problem of whether or not a given string
    of symbols is a well-formed You are Reading the Name of this Esolang program is undecidable.

    November 1, 2007: The Cabra programming language,
    successor of sorts to &lt;a href="/projects/burro/"&gt;Burro&lt;/a&gt;, has been released.
    Cabra programs form, not a group, but a dioid -- an idempotent semiring --
    under the operations of sequential and parallel composition.

    October 26, 2007: The Burro programming language, after two years
    (on and off) of design work, has finally been released.  Burro is a Brainfuck-like language
    whose programs form an algebraical group under the operation of concatenation (roughly
    speaking -- see the docs for the complete picture.)

    September 30, 2007: The Maentwrong language, predecessor of
    [[Befunge-93]], and thought by me to be lost forever (again), was found (again)
    on a long-forgotten backup disc.  It has been brought forth into the light
    of the projects directory (again) for whatever it's worth.
    
"catseye.mine.nu No Longer in Service":

    August 28, 2007: The catseye.mine.nu server is no longer in service
    This has two consequences:  The old http://catseye.mine.nu:8080/
    URL prefix for this site will no longer redirect here to catseye.tc,
    and the Subversion repositories served by catseye.mine.nu
    will no longer be publicly available.
    
    The catseye.webhop.net redirect will continue to work, and the
    tarball releases of projects will still be available from catseye.tc.
    
    Whether the catseye.mine.nu server will ever go up again or not depends
    on too many factors for me to be able to say at this time.  I definately want to
    keep providing publicly available source code repositories of the projects, but due
    to circumstances it will have to be a low priority goal over the next few months.
    
"Updates to SMITH and REDGREEN":

  description: |
    July 22, 2007: The SMITH language has been updated in
    a tiny but significant way: overwriting instructions with other instructions
    is now defined.  The reference implementation now implements this sanely as
    well.  Thanks to Nathan Thern for pointing this out (and for submitting a
    SMITH version of "99 Bottles of Beer"!)
    
    Some bugs in [[REDGREEN]] have been fixed
    as well: the documentation claims that Wires and Sparks behave per the
    WireWorld automaton, and that Zappy and BigZappy set things on fire.  The
    ALPACA implementation of REDGREEN now properly implements these rules.
    Thanks to Stewart Gordon for pointing these bugs out.
    
    Also, I dug up [[noise]] and put
    it in the projects.  I swear there was a manual page for it too, but I can't find it.

  description: |
    June 17, 2007: The Hev programming language has been released.
    Hev allows programming in infix notation, but at the same time,
    never needs parentheses and never forces you to memorize precedence tables!
    Truly, a major breakthrough.

    May 15, 2007: Most significantly, a project has been added for
    Zzrk, a text adventure
    game written in a meta-language intended for building compilers (Zz).
    
    I also brought [[GraNoLa/M]] and [[SP\ASM]]
    out of those dusty ol' boxes in the attic and added them to the line-up.
    
    [[REDGREEN]], [[Braktif]], and [[Circute]]
    have also been split off from the main [[ALPACA]]
    distribution, and live in projects of their own.
    
    I also polished the site design a wee bit.
