    In releasing software as [[Open-source|open-source]]
    [[Cat's Eye Technologies]] has a preference for the 3-clause BSD
    License. It is an OSI Certified license (for whatever that's worth)
    which is succinct, pointific, and written entirely in readable legal
    language. It does not come off like a manifesto, nor does it contain any
    cute puns. (Call us stodgy if you like, but a license just doesn't
    strike us as an appropriate place for those things.)
