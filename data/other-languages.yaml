  - String-rewriting
  abstract: |
    The Thue programming language was invented by
    John Colagioia in early 2000.  It is named after the computational
    regimen it is based on — a pure string-rewriting process called a
    _semi-Thue grammar_, which is named for (and possibly created
    by) the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue (pronounced "TOO-ay").
    
    Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways
    to construe constraint-based programming.  It is to the constraint-based
    paradigm what languages like OISC are to the imperative paradigm;
    in other words, it's a tar pit.
