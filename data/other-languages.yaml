    If an implementation of something here is written in C99,
    that implies you need POSIX to compile it, too.
    But some things here written in C99 can also be compiled as
    ANSI C by defining a symbol -- see the Makefile as appropriate.

  commentary: |
    For any software project, it's important that you choose the right
    language to develop it in. That's why you'll always choose C++, no
    matter what the project is!
    
    Why will you choose C++? Because it's popular, so a lot of programmers
    know it. And a lot of programmers means a lot of competition, and that
    means you'll be able to hire programmers at the lowest rate! This will
    surely offset whatever costs might be incurred from choosing an
    ill-suited programming language and hiring programmers who work at the
    lowest rate.
    
    And why *is* C++ such a popular programming language?
    
    Is it because it's a good programming language? Hardly. That's like
    saying that coffee is a popular beverage because it's healthful.
    
    No, C++ is popular because C++ is popular. Hey, Google is a big,
    successful company, and I hear they use C++... it must be *why* they're
    successful! You should use C++ too!
    
    But that's not the only reason. C++ is popular because programmers
    *like* it. I suppose the question then is, *why* do programmers like it?
    
    Is it because C++ makes it easy to write correct, maintainable code? Is
    it because C++ is easy to learn? Is it because there are things you can
    do in C++ that you can't do in any other language? Is it that C++ lets
    your programs run as fast as they possibly can?
    
    Anyone who has ever used C++ can tell you the answer to all of those
    questions: No. (No, not even when it comes to making your program run as
    fast as it can. C++ allows so much control over the low-level workings
    of the program that the compiler cannot make optimizations that it
    otherwise could, if the programmer were constrained to working at a
    higher level of abstraction.)
    
    So what is it about C++ that makes programmers like it?
    
    Well, I have a theory. While most "normal" people feel that their lives
    are too complicated, too full of arbitrary rules and boring details and
    essentially meaningless things to remember, there's a certain strain of
    psychology that actually *thrives* on complexity like this, because such
    complexity *generates gratuitous expertise*.
    
    What I mean by this is that if a system is easy to master, then there's
    no opportunity to show off your mastery of it. There's no way to display
    your dominance through your command of minutiae and knowledge of trivia.
    And if that's what really motivates you, then, well, you're going to
    avoid that system, because it doesn't provide you anything to work with
    in the social game you want to play. Instead, you'll look for something
    with a lot of nooks and crannies and bells and whistles and jargon and
    buzzwords that you can familiarize yourself with, and you'll take every
    opportunity to demonstrate that you are More Familiar with It than Thou.
    You'll look for something like... well, like C++.
    
    And if it so happens that programmers with this general personality type
    *also* like the idea of *total control over their program* — and while
    I'm no expert on psychology, somehow that seems likely — C++'ll have'em
    downright hooked.

CSS:

  commentary: |
    If I, as a programmer, were to tell you that CSS is the ultimate hacking
    language, would you be surprised? After all, it's not even a
    [Programming Language], really. But that doesn't really
    matter, does it? It meets the only possible criterion there could be for
    the ultimate hacking language: in order to achieve the effect that what
    you want, you have to hack and hack and hack...
    
    So, I have a question. If CSS is so superior to [those awful tables
    which should never ever be used for
    layout](http://phrogz.net/CSS/HowToDevelopWithCSS.html#tables), how come
    a simple and much desired three-column layout, so trivial to construct
    with a table, is considered [one of the holy grails of
    CSS](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail)?
    
    Seems that the real solution to this would be to have some set of
    elements that has the layout behaviour of tables but without the "treat
    this as tabular data, would you please" semantics. I suppose that's what
    `display: table-cell` *et al* is for — if only more browsers supported
    it.
    
    I kvetch, but there *is* one very nice thing about CSS: unlike
    [[Javascript]], it's declarative, and nowhere near as
    [powerful as a Turing machine](universality.html). So, it might make
    your page look ugly in nine out of ten browsers six out of seven days of
    the week, but at least it probably won't hang, or crash, or corrupt the
    browser's state.

  description: |
    Javascript (also and more properly known as ECMAScript) is a
    [[Programming Language]] that some web browsers implement
    in order to let scripts control the dynamic behaviour of a web page,
    such as what happens when the user clicks on some region of text.
  commentary: |    
    We at [[Cat's Eye Technologies]] have long taken a dim view of this
    predominant application of Javascript. It's gratuitous; web pages exist
    in order to convey information, not be playthings. Managing the user
    interface is the *browser*'s job; what makes the *page* think it can do
    it better? But more to the point, putting a
    [[shown Turing-complete]] control language in a browser is a
    way to let web pages be just as impossible to predict, and just as
    buggy, as general computer programs. Multiply this by the number and
    degree of variations between Javascript specifications and
    implementations to experience the full hellishness of this fact.
    
    Or, as we used to say, *web pages shouldn't crash your browser*.
    
    But we also admit that Javascript, used judiciously, can improve the
    usability of a web page.
    
    So we have decided to compromise. Our policy regarding Javascript is as
    follows.
    
    -   *If you don't like it, turn it off.*
    
        Everything on this website is navigable even with Javascript
        disabled. (It even looks acceptable without styling. So if you don't
        like our far-out background graphics, or you want the genuine
        experience of surfing the web circa 1996, try turning off
        [[CSS]] too.) If you're using a browser that doesn't allow
        you to disable these features, you might want to consider why you
        chose to use a tool that takes that power away from you.
    
    -   *Use commodity components.*
    
        As much as we like to "roll our own" computational stuff here at
        Cat's Eye Technologies, the application domain of Javascript
        generally makes that option too risky. Correct Javascript must not
        only encode a correct algorithm, it must correctly account for
        differences between Javascript implementations and browsers. In
        addition, being interactive, any incorrect Javascript will have a
        direct negative impact on the user experience.
    
        So what we do is we use commodity components -- open-source
        Javascript modules that are community-developed. The broad base of
        users and developers helps ensure that the scripts are tested both
        deeply and broadly (that is, across a large cross-section of
        browsers.)
    
    -   *Keep it simple, stupid.*
    
        When writing our own Javascript is unavoidable, we keep it as simple
        as possible. Is there a way to write it that doesn't involve a loop?
        Is there a way to accomplish the same thing using stylesheets
        instead? Does the interactive feature actually not make the site
        more usable? If the answers to any of these are "yes" then there's a
        good chance that the script they're being asked about won't get
        written.

    Files in the Ophis assembler format often have the file extension `.oph`,
    although files written the Ophis' predecessor, P65, with the `.p65` file extension,
    will generally build with Ophis too.
    You'll need an assembler that conforms to Ophis' syntax in order
    to build executables from these files, and your best bet with that is
    probably the Ophis assembler itself.

      with a BIOS, keyboard, and basic VGA is the minimum to make
      it worthwhile.  While most modern PC's can handle that reasonably
      well, often a better choice — because it can run under a modern OS,
      rather than actually dedicating the entire computer to it —
      is to run such things under an emulator.  In which case,
      we recommend Bochs.
