    A surprisingly intricate dungeon exploration game from the era of
    personal computers that didn't need internal fans.  In first-person
    perspective, and in real time, a party of four adventurers hack and slash
    their way past various nasties, eating their remains, throwing switches,
    throwing pieces of clothing, triggering traps, casting spells, and watching
    the world fade to black around them as their last torch is consumed.

    I like that it's not *just* a war game; you feel like you're a
    steward of the civilization you've fostered.  It's a bit like a sim game in that
    respect.  Educational, too; it encourages you build a mental model of how history
    works, based on technological and social advances.  An oversimplified model, to be
    sure, but something is better than nothing.  I mean, did I ever really think about
    how sewer systems and refrigeration changed life as we know it before playing
    this game?  Probably not.

    A classic.  I like how it manages to unify, to an extent, using the "construction set" to
    build your own levels, and playing the level (since playing a level essentially means to
    complete its construction satisfactorily.)  I also like how it naturally accomodates multiple
    solutions.
    
    People sometimes tell me how [[RUBE]] reminds them of this game.
    
    Every so often, in a television commercial or similar, I hear the *exact same*
    squeaking sound that the trapdoor made in this game, and I have a flashback to it.
    (That sound sample must be in the public domain or something.)

    I'm a sucker for "construction sets" (games that come with a level editor), and
    a sucker for adventure games, so this would seem a natural fit.  It's actually
    a construction set for role-playing games, though, although suited for ones containing
    some measure of puzzle-solving.  The "language" in which the game is described is
    somewhat interesting; individual objects can have effects associated with them
    (such as summon monster, raise health, display a message, etc.,) and they can be
    stacked in a single square; the square can be told to trigger all the objects when
    the player walks over it, or bumps into it.

    I'm not at all a fan of Roger Zelazny's stuff, but this is one of the best-hacked
    Angband's out there, and has a really good gameplay balance.

    Alexander takes a mint.
    
    This game is fairly well written, which is in stark contrast to the other
    games in the King's Quest series, which are simply painful.
    
    If, however, you like things that are so bad that they are *absurdly* bad
    (and considering what website you're visiting, that's not unlikely,)
    King's Quest IV has moments of morbidity that may make it worthwhile:
    Graham's scream as he falls off the icy cliffs, and the narrator's jesting about
    "dying for a drink."  But don't even try playing the endgame without a walkthrough.

    I wasn't fortunate enough to play this until 2003.
    This was, of course, long after the hardware that it made so many demands on was obsolete,
    and could only be emulated awkwardly â€” either by <a class="external" href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/">Exult</a>,
    which (when I tried it) was kind of hard to set up, or by switching between real mode and protected mode
    thousands of times a second, which is just about as happy as it sounds.

    It deserves mention if for no other reason than you get to carve your own
    dungeon out of the rock as part of the game.

Alphaman:
  type: Game
  genre: Roguelike
  platform: MS-DOS
  controls: keyboard

  commentary: |
    A post-apocalyptic roguelike which is alternately realistic (I'm thinking
    particularly of the weather patterns) and silly (you can be attacked by
    monsters called the Bush and the Quayle... and let's not forget about
    the Venetian Blind!)  The name is clearly a play on "Omega Man".  One
    of the best mutant powers to have is Mechanical Genius, which lets you
    take apart gadgets (like microwave ovens) and create new and interesting
    gadgets.
