Animals:
  type: Game
  genre: Guessing
  vintage: true
  description: |
    Animals is a classic "expert system" game.  The computer asks you to think of an
    animal, and then asks you a series of yes/no questions in an attempt to
    discover what animal you chose.  If it comes to the wrong conclusion, it
    asks you for a question that would distinguish the animal that you chose,
    and adds it to its database.  In this way it "learns" about more animals
    as more games are played.

Flip:
  type: Game
  genre: Guessing
  vintage: true
  description: |
    Flip is a very simple computer game by John S. James which first appeared
    in the March/April 1977 edition of _Creative Computing_.
    In the game, the computer flips a virtual coin 50 times, and the object is
    for you to guess whether the coin will come up heads or tails each time.
    What makes it interesting is that the coin is not fair.  The computer tries
    to find patterns in your guesses, and exploit them by biasing the coin toss
    away from what it thinks you are likely to guess next.

  description: |
    Hunt the Wumpus is a classic topological mythical-beast-hunting game
    from the era of teletypes.  [[Gregory Yob]] was disappointed by the
    number of games based on "find an objective hidden on a
    [[2-dimensional]] grid", and decided to design one that was based on
    a world less orthogonal.
