Animals:
  type: Game
  genre: Guessing
  vintage: true
  description: |
    A classic "expert system" game.  The computer asks you to think of an
    animal, and then asks you a series of yes/no questions in an attempt to
    discover what animal you chose.  If it comes to the wrong conclusion, it
    asks you for a question that would distinguish the animal that you chose,
    and adds it to its database.  In this way it "learns" about more animals
    as more games are played.
