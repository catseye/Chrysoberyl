    Apple Befunge is a variant of Befunge for the Apple ][+ which resembles
    Befunge-93, with some extra Befunge-96-esque instructions and some
    Apple ][+-specific instructions.

Castile:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  paradigms:
  - Imperative
  - Functional
  description: |
    Castile is an unremarkable programming language which exists mainly
    because an unremarkable evaluator/compiler for it was written.  It is
    a bit like [[ANSI C]] except with proper union types (and no typecasts.)  Local
    variables are mutable, but arguments and globals aren't.  The compiler
    supports several backends, including [[Javascript]] and [[Ruby]].

SixtyPical:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Machine language
  paradigms:
  - Imperative
  description: |
    SixtyPical is a very low-level programming language, similar to 6502
    assembly, which defines a set of static analyses via type-checking and
    abstract interpretation (liveness analysis of variables, i.e. memory
    locations.)

Tamsin:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  paradigms:
  - Functional
  - Logic programming
  - Metalanguage
  description: |
    Tamsin is an oddball little language that can't decide if it's a
    meta-language, a programming language, or a [[Perl|rubbish lister]].
    Its primary goal is to allow the rapid development of parsers,
    static analyzers, interpreters, and compilers, and to allow them
    to be expressed *compactly*.
