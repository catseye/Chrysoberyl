  abstract: |
    ALPACA is a meta-language for describing cellular automata. 
  commentary: |-
    The acronym is not quite accurate, as the automata are not in fact arbitrary, but it's
    a nice acronym.
    
    ALPACA is one of the few of my languages in which I've actually implemented
    other languages (or, well, cellular automata — close enough).  These are, namely,
    [[REDGREEN]], [[Braktif]], [[Circute]], and [[Jaccia and Jacciata]].

Arboretuum:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  abstract: |
    Arboretuum is an experimental language based on _forest-rewriting_,
    a variant of tree-rewriting in which multiple trees are rewritten simultaneously.
    The language was intended for specifying compilers, with each tree representing
    a major compiler data structure (AST, symbol table, output buffer, etc.,)
    however, this idea was not entirely successful.  Regardless, Arboretuum is
    Turing-complete, as tree-rewriting is simply a special case of forest-rewriting.

    Bear Food was a horrible language defined by an interpreter that

    This same example code also took a very divergent line of evolution, eventually
    becoming the programming language [[Var'aq]].

    beta-Juliet is a minimal event-based language.  Each event is caused by some other event.
    Event causation is conditional based on which of two given events occurred more recently.
    
    Portia is a preprocessor for beta-Juliet which allows large, regular, finite sets of events
    to be described succinctly.
    
    Version 2.0 of beta-Juliet (formerly known as "2iota") allows infinite sets of events to be

Beturing:

  abstract: |
    Beturing is a "Befunge-flavoured" language for describing Turing
    machines; both the tape and the finite control are laid out two-dimensionally.
    In addition, the finite control must be expressed as a planar graph (no
    edge representing a transition may cross any other edge.) It was devised
    this way as a test of the so-called "wire-crossing problem". It turns out
    that there are universal Turing machines with finite controls that are planar
    graphs, so Beturing is Turing-complete.

Burro:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Burro is a [[brainfuck]]-like programming language whose programs
    form an algebraical _group_ (modulo the equivalence relation of "computes the
    same function") under the operation of concatenation. The upshot of this
    is that, for every Burro program, we can find an _antiprogram_ which, when
    appended to the program, forms a "no-op" program which has no effect.
     This is a form of reversible computing, but unlike most reversible languages
    where it is the execution of the program that is "undone", in Burro, it is
    the program itself which is annihiliated by its antiprogram.  Burro 1.0
    was released in fall of 2007, but proved not to form a proper group. This
    shortcoming was rectified in summer of 2010.

Dieter:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  summary: A language which conflates modules and type qualifiers
  abstract: |
    Dieter (as in the German masculine given name Dieter, not dieter as in
    "one who diets") is a little experimental programming language that
    conflates *type qualifiers* with *modules* to produce something
    reminiscent of object-orientation.  It demonstrates another way of
    thinking about objects, or rather, classes: not so much as
    *aggregates of data* as *associations of predicates*.
    
    Dieter was intended as a way to make Hungarian notation part of the type
    system, and thus automatically checkable.  However, it also suggests
    possible ways of dealing with the problems of aliasing — that is,
    determining if two pointers cannot possibly point to the same data, for
    safety and optimization considerations.

  summary: A safe language with explicit memory deallocation
  abstract: |
    Eightebed is a small language with explicit `malloc` and `free`.
    Through a modicum of static analysis
    and runtime support, Eightebed is safe: it is not possible to dereference a dangling
    pointer or otherwise incorrectly-populated memory.
    
    Eightebed was designed as a counter-example to Gregor Richards' claim that such
    a language would either need a garbage collector, or not actually implement `free`.
    Eightebed has a real `free` and has no garbage collector.

    Befunge is now old enough to drink in its native land of Canada.  To celebrate
    this, I thought I'd get Befunge-93 drunk to see what would happen.  What
    happened was Flobnar, an esolang which is in many respects a functional dual
    of Befunge-93; most of the symbols have analogous meanings, but execution
    proceeds in a much more dataflow-like fashion.

Full Moon Fever:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: DSL
  summary: A language for describing ANSI terminal animations
  abstract: |
    Full Moon Fever is a language for describing ASCII animations.
    It was used to deliver animated screens on Chris Pressey's BBS
    (when it was operational in the early 90's) via ANSI terminal control codes.
    This probably counts as his first proper language, even though
    it wasn't a full programming language, because it had
    the usual machinery (syntax, parser, interpreter...)
    Lives on, in a somewhat distended form, as a sub-language of
    [[ILLGOL]].
  commentary: |-
    I believe the name "Full Moon Fever" came from a mis-remembering
    of the title of the song "Full Moon Boogie" by Jan Hammer and
    that other guy.

  - song title

  abstract: |
    Madison is a language in which one can state proofs of properties

    such as resolution, are not used; indeed, term-rewriting itself is
    used to check the proofs.  Both direct proof and proof by induction
    are supported.  Induction in a proof must be across a structure which
    has a well-founded inductive definition.  Such structures can be thought
    of as types, although this is largely nominal; the traditional typelessness
    of term-rewiting systems is largely retained.

Maentwrog:

  summary: A simple RPN-calculator-based language
  abstract: |
    Maentwrog is an RPN-calculator-turned-FORTH-interpreter, which
    probably counts as Chris Pressey's first proper programming language.
    It was implemented on his Amiga 500 in 1993, then lost and unearthed
    multiple times.  It is hardly remarkable, save that it spawned [[Befunge-93]].
  commentary: |-
    There are no extant example programs from the time the language was first
    implemented — I tried writing the Sieve of Eratosthenes in it once,
    but never got it to work, probably because `==` was not
    implemented correctly.  Recently, example programs and a description of the
    language (which has become the provisional spec) have been provided by
    Marinus — thanks Marinus!
    
    Maentwrog is the name of a town in Wales, but the usage of its name
    for this language came via Douglas Adams' "The Meaning of Liff",
    wherein it is defined thusly:
    "MAENTWROG (n. Welsh) Celtic word for a computer spelling mistake."

Nhohnhehr: 
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Nhohnhehr is a remotely fungeoid language which explores the design
    space between having a fixed playfield versus an expandable one.  When the
    instruction pointer reaches the edge of the playfield (the "room"), whether
    it wraps around or creates a new room and adjoins it to that edge, depends
    on the current _edge mode_ of the program.  New copies of rooms may be rotated
    before being adjoined to existing rooms, but rooms are otherwise immutable.

    noit o' mnain worb is a probabilistic particle automaton that
    uses pressure between randomly moving particles to approximate the behaviour
    of circuits.  It can approximate computation with these circuits, too, but
    it's so lossy that it has more value as just a neat toy to watch.

Okapi: 
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Okapi is a language I designed as an anniversary present for my
    wife(!). In it, the only means of control flow is throwing exceptions, and
    as if this wasn't enough, there are two restrictions on exceptions that are
    thrown — they must be divide-by-zero exceptions, and they must be caught
    in a lexically enclosing block.  Nor is there any facility to "retry" after
    an exception is caught. The language is nonetheless Turing-complete.

Oozlybub and Murphy:

    The name of this language is Oozlybub and Murphy. Despite appearances,

    Oozlybub. The fact that the language is not entirely named Oozlybub is named
    Murphy. Deal with it.  For the sake of providing an "olde tyme esoterickal
    de-sign", the language combines several unusual features, including multiple
    interleaved parse streams, infinitely long variable names, gratuitously strong
    typing, and only-conjectural Turing completeness.

Treacle:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Experimental language
  abstract: |
    Treacle is an experimental compiler-definition language based on
    _context rewriting_, an expressive variant of term rewriting that generalizes
    the forest-rewriting used by its predecessor [[Arboretuum]].  In context rewriting,
    a separation is made between _names_ and _variables_, and patterns may contain
    _holes_ inside which subpatterns may match at any depth.

Unlikely:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Unlikely is a programming language that conflates objects with
    continuations, and methods with labels.  It exposes program structures as
    objects with commensurate inheritance relationships.  It also takes dependency
    injection to the logical extreme: if some class is used by an object, that
    class *must* be specified when the object is instantiated.

Velo: 
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Velo is a vaguely Ruby-inspired "scripting" language which unifies
    strings with code blocks, and scripts with object classes.  Curly braces
    delimit string literals, and there is no difference between a string literal
    and a block of code given to, say, an `if` statement.  Any given script is
    an object, which inherits from the root object in delegation-OO style.

Wunnel: 
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Wunnel is a two-dimensional language which draws from the [[1L]]
    family of languages and incorporates features from [[reMorse]]. The name
    is both a play on the pronunciation of "1L", and a recursive portmanteau
    of the words _Wunnel_ and _tunnel_ which is used to describe the long sequences
    of identical instructions (often nops) used in Wunnel programs to sync up
    remote parts of the program.  (Information on this language is only available
    on the esowiki for now.)

Xoomonk: 
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  abstract: |
    Xoomonk is a programming language in which _malingering updatable
    stores_ are first-class objects.  Malingering updatable stores unify several
    language constructs, including procedure activations, named parameters, and
    object-like data structures.
    
    The Xoomonk project is also a bit of an experiment
    in _test-driven language design_. The specification includes examples in
    the format of [[Falderal]] tests, which were written while the language was
    being designed and could be used to compare an implementation (when one is
    written) against the spec.

    ZOWIE is a machine-like language in which all operations *including
    structured control flow* are memory-mapped.  Control flow is structured in
    the sense of structured programming — the programmer never deals with
    `goto`s, or offsets or labels of any kind.  Instead, the program writes to
    a memory location to mark the beginning or end of a loop or conditional.
