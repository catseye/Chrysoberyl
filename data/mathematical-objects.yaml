Galois connection:
  type: Mathematical Object
  description: |
    A Galois connection is a pair of complementary maps with certain
    properties between a pair of complementary sets.
    
    Galois connections provide a mathematical basis for abstract
    interpretation, and they are possibly easiest to understand from
    examples given in that context.
    
    We can think of our pair of sets as being a set of *concrete* values
    (such as {0, 1, 2, ... }) and a set of *abstract* values (such as
    {`int`, `even`, `odd`, `power-of-two`, `prime`, ... }).
    
    We then think of our pair of maps as being an *abstractifying* map which
    takes elements of the concrete value set and sends them to elements of
    the abstract value set, and a *concretizing* map which takes elements of
    the abstract value set and sends them to elements of the concrete value
    set.
    
    This pair of maps is a Galois connection when, if some abstract value
    (such as `even`) maps to some set of concrete values (such as {2, 4, 6,
    8, ... }), then any concrete value in that set (such as 8) also maps to
    some (possibly specialized) instance of the abstract value (such as
    `power-of-two`).
    
    That's not quite the whole story, but it seems like the most intuitive
    version to me.
    
    Now there's nothing saying that the sets have to be "abstract" or
    "concrete" or that the maps have to be "abstractifying" or
    "concretizing" -- those are just from this one application in abstract
    interpretation. On the other hand, the structure inherent in the Galois
    connection does lend itself to relationships like this.


Thue system:
  type: Mathematical Object
  description: |
    This is from Lewis & Papadimitriou, *Elements of the Theory of
    Computation*, 6.4.2. Thue Systems.
    
    A Thue system is a finite set of unordered pairs of strings that
    determines an equivalence relation on strings thusly: two strings are
    *equivalent* under the system if one can be transformed into the other
    by successively replacing substrings that are found as one member of
    some pair with the other member of that pair.
    
    The word problem for Thue systems is the problem of determining, given a
    Thue system J and two strings x and y, whether or not x and y are
    equivalent.
    
    The word problem for Thue systems is unsolvable. Moreover, there is a
    *fixed* Thue system J0 and a string w0 such that the problem of
    determining whether w is equivalent to w0 by J0 for an abritrary
    string w is also unsolvable.
    
    Thue systems are bidirectional in this sense: for every u → w, there is
    also a w ← u. A system which is unidirectional, in which the
    replacements only occur in one direction, is called a _semi-Thue system_.
