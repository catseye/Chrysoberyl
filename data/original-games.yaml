    Bubble Escape is a video game written for the [[Commodore 64]] where you
    must guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  Was originally written
    in [[Commodore BASIC 2.0]] by a young me in the 80's.  Was rewritten in
    [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly language]] by a middle-aged me in the
    late aughts.  Was pared down so that (crunched) it fit into 2K, christened
    "Bubble Escape 2K", and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]]
    where (surprisingly, to me!) it got first place in its class.

    Corona: Realm of Magic is an unfinished roguelike written in
    [[Perl]].  It was written on top of a framework I was writing at the time that I
    called CARPE DIEM (Computer-Assisted Role-Playing Engine for Diverse Interactive
    Entertainment Modules.)

Cyclobots:
  type: Game
  genre: Toy

  authors:

  inception-date: ca 1994
  development-stage: mature
  description: |
    Cyclobots is an automaton that consists of a number of little virtual
    "turtle robots" called "cyclobots".  Each cyclobot moves with a constant
    velocity, and tries to follow exactly one other cyclobot, adjusting
    its heading to point towards the cyclobot it is following.
    No cylobot is followed by more than one cyclobot.
    
    A group of cyclobots tends to fall into one of several semi-stable
    patterns.  The simplest of these is just a rotating circle, but
    more complex, [trefoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot)-like
    patterns are more common.
  commentary: |
    It's not really a game â€” or, rather, it's a game in the same way John
    Conway's Game of Life is a game.  I originally called it an
    "interactive desktop toy".
    
    I originally conceived of this automaton in or around 1994, and implemented
    it immediately in Visual Basic.  I remember the year because I wrote the
    first implementation of [[SMETANA]] in Visual Basic at about the same time.
    
    The original implementation had a few features which are not present (yet)
    in the HTML5 version: cyclobots could collide with each other, and the user
    could use the mouse to attract/repel them from a chosen point.

    Dungeons of Ekileugor is a roguelike written for the [[Commodore VIC-20]],
    which, despite the limitations of that platform, supports a respectable
    set of the usual "dungeon furniture": reasonably generated dungeon levels
    with tunnels and rooms whose contents are hidden until you enter,
    monsters, treasure, potions, traps, chests, combat with experience points,
    etc.
