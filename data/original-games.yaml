    Bubble Escape is a video game written for the [[Commodore 64]] where you
    must guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  Was originally written
    in [[Commodore BASIC 2.0]] by a young me in the 80's.  Was rewritten in
    [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly language]] by a middle-aged me in the
    late aughts.  Was pared down so that (crunched) it fit into 2K, christened
    "Bubble Escape 2K", and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]]
    where (surprisingly, to me!) it got first place in its class.

    Dungeons of Ekileugor is a roguelike written for the [[Commodore VIC-20]],
    which, despite the limitations of that platform, supports a respectable
    set of the usual "dungeon furniture": reasonably generated dungeon levels
    with tunnels and rooms whose contents are hidden until you enter,
    monsters, treasure, potions, traps, chests, combat with experience points,
    etc.
