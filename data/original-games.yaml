      A video game written for the Commodore 64 where you must
      guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  Was originally written in BASIC by a young me in the 80's.
      Was rewritten in 6502 assembly language by a middle-aged me in the late oughts.  Was pared
      down so that (crunched) it fit into 2K, christened "Bubble Escape 2K", and submitted to the Mini Game Competition 2009
      where (surprisingly, to me!) it got first place in its class.
    implementations:
    - 'Bubble Escape: BASIC'
    - 'Bubble Escape 2K'
    - 'Bubble Escape 8K'
