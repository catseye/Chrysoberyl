    Bubble Escape is a video game written for the [[Commodore 64]] where the
    player must guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.  It was originally
    designed and implemented in [[Commodore BASIC 2.0]] in the mid-80's, and
    rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly language]] in the late 00's.
    The assembly version was pared down so that (crunched) it fit into 2K,
    christened "Bubble Escape 2K", and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]]
    where it won first place in its class.

    Dungeons of Ekileugor is a roguelike written for the [[Commodore VIC-20]],
    which, despite the limitations of that platform, supports a respectable

    with tunnels and rooms whose contents are hidden until you enter,
    monsters, treasure, potions, traps, chests, combat with experience points,
    etc.
