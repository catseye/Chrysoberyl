    I was stuck on this one for a long time, because I couldn't seem to
    remove common sense from my brain.  Whether I had gotten the game
    stuck in an unsolvable state, or I just didn't notice that it worked, I don't
    know.  When I picked it up again years later, I finished it, but I did get
    a fair number of hints from other people who had played it, in between.

    With graphics.  This was apparently a demo for an adventure authoring system of
    some kind, but it stands on its own as a game, although perhaps not the best one.
    I'm proud to say that I solved this with no hints or walkthroughs, although I should add,
    it's not a particularly difficult game.

The Africa Adventure:

    Treasure-oriented.  An interesting game, although parts are probably
    borderline politically incorrect at this point in history (but really, the
    same can be said for the original _Get Smart_.)  So far, I've gotten
    about half the possible points.
    I either can't remember, or never figured out, how to get the wood without
    getting bitten by the spider.  I can deal with the viper and the alligator, 
    but am not clear on the purpose behind either.  No idea what the
    foul-smelling stuff or the wild dog is for...

Cranston Manor:

    With graphics.  Treasure-oriented.  Not the best adventure game, certainly,
    but memorable for some reason.  Never solved it, but pretty sure I could without
    too much help, if I ever found the time to go back to it.

Creature Venture:
  type: Game

  commentary: |
    With graphics.  Might have been treasure-oriented; I don't remember.  The
    main feature, though, is the Oozlybub, a creature which has popped up in a
    few other places in artistic endeavours in my life, including being part of the
    name of my programming language [[Oozlybub and Murphy]].

Time & Magick:
  type: Game
  genre: Text Adventure
  platform: Amiga 500
  authors: []
  no-specification: true
  commentary: |
    With graphics.  Actually a trilogy of three games, some of which are treasure-oriented.
    The one about venturing through time to stop the Timelords from destroying the world
    or whatever seemed pretty well put together, as did the one where you start with 100%
    sanity but gradually lose it over time, but the third one, with the spells which require
    certain objects as foci, seemed kind of weak.

The Secret of St. Bride's:

  commentary: |
    Intriguing, but difficult.  Unlike most of the others on this list, I only came across
    this game a few years back, and have never gotten very far in it.  I will probably end up
    consulting a walkthrough, if I ever find the time to go back to it.

Dungeon (MIT):
  type: Game
  genre: Text Adventure

  commentary: |
    Treasure-oriented.  A classic, which captured some of the MIT hacker culture of
    the time, and foisted it on a general audience when it was repackaged as the Zork
    trilogy.  I have actually solved most of the main game, but never got to a point where
    I can start the endgame.
