    In contrast to all the ultra-minimal Brainfuck interpreters and
    compilers out there, I figured I should write a monster: the Platonic Ideal BrainFuck Interpreter.
    Written in Erlang, it contains just about every feature under the sun, including the kitchen sink.
    I sort of lost interest when I was adding profiling and discovered there were several different
    extant reckonings of a "number of instructions executed" metric for Brainfuck.  I guess it was that
    point that made me recognize just how silly this project was...

    Based on the observation that Smallfuck, lacking the (assumed-)infinite tape of Brainfuck,
    can only express finite-state automata, I wrote a little program in C to compile Smallfuck programs to
    (generally gigantic) lookup-tables.

    Seeing that there was no *non*-pathological implementation of Alex Smith's
    beautiful [[Underload]] language in C, I undertook that project one evening.
    (In the company of a bottle of really fine wine.  Why, it cost almost twelve dollars.)
    The result is one of the most pedantic and boring Underload interpreters known to
    man.  Perhaps the most interesting property of it is its name, `stringie`, which was
    an accident.

    PL-{GOTO}.NET is a compiler for the language PL-{GOTO}
    from Brainerd and Landweber's *Theory of Computation*
    (1974; ISBN 0471095850). PL-{GOTO} can express exactly the
    primitive recursive functions, and thus PL-{GOTO} programs
    always terminate. PL-{GOTO}.NET generates MSIL code which
    can then (using `ilasm`) be turned into a .NET
    executable.  It can also execute PL-{GOTO} programs
    directly.
  commentary: |-
    I've been idly fascinated by the primitive recursive example programming language
    PL-{GOTO} from Brainerd and Landweber's *Theory of Computation* for some time.
    And for some reason I will never be able to explain, I had the craving to implement a compiler
    which could produce .NET executables by generating MSIL assembly language.  And putting
    those two together — well, that struck me as a respectably absurd match, so that's what I did.
    The compiler is written in Haskell and uses Parsec for parsing PL-{GOTO} programs; I tried
    to keep the grammar true to what is presented in the book, not refactoring it to be LL(1), and
    keeping the `←` symbol for assignment.
