  description: |
    In contrast to all the ultra-minimal Brainfuck interpreters and
    compilers out there, I figured I should write a monster: the Platonic Ideal BrainFuck Interpreter.
    Written in Erlang, it contains just about every feature under the sun, including the kitchen sink.
    I sort of lost interest when I was adding profiling and discovered there were several different
    extant reckonings of a "number of instructions executed" metric for Brainfuck.  I guess it was that
    point that made me recognize just how silly this project was...

  description: |
    PL-{GOTO}.NET is a compiler for the language PL-{GOTO}
    from Brainerd and Landweber's *[[Theory of Computation]]*
    PL-{GOTO} can express exactly the
    primitive recursive functions, and thus PL-{GOTO} programs
    always terminate. PL-{GOTO}.NET generates MSIL code which
    can then (using `ilasm`) be turned into a .NET
    executable.  It can also execute PL-{GOTO} programs
    directly.

Thue:
  type: Programming Language
  genre: Esolang
  paradigms:
  - String-rewriting
  - Non-deterministic
  computational-class: believed Turing-complete
  esowiki: Thue
  authors:
  - John Colagioia
  description: |
    The Thue programming language was invented by
    John Colagioia in early 2000.  It is named after the computational
    regimen it is based on — a pure string-rewriting process called a
    _semi-Thue grammar_, which is named for (and possibly created
    by) the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue (pronounced "TOO-ay").
    
    Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways
    to construe constraint-based programming.  It is to the constraint-based
    paradigm what languages like OISC are to the imperative paradigm;
    in other words, it's a tar pit.
