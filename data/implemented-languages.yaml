  commentary: |
    I implemented Aubergine because the reference interpreter is buggy and
    I wanted a version that actually implemented the unbounded integers that
    the language description suggests.  After implementing it, I was familiar
    enough with it to write a sketch of a proof of its [[Turing-complete]]ness.

    In contrast to all the ultra-minimal Brainfuck interpreters and
    compilers out there, I figured I should write a monster: the Platonic Ideal BrainFuck Interpreter.
    Written in Erlang, it contains just about every feature under the sun, including the kitchen sink.
    I sort of lost interest when I was adding profiling and discovered there were several different
    extant reckonings of a "number of instructions executed" metric for Brainfuck.  I guess it was that
    point that made me recognize just how silly this project was...

  description: |
    PL-{GOTO}.NET is a compiler for the language PL-{GOTO}
    from Brainerd and Landweber's *[[Theory of Computation]]*
    PL-{GOTO} can express exactly the
    primitive recursive functions, and thus PL-{GOTO} programs
    always terminate. PL-{GOTO}.NET generates MSIL code which
    can then (using `ilasm`) be turned into a .NET
    executable.  It can also execute PL-{GOTO} programs
    directly.
  commentary: |-
    I've been idly fascinated by the primitive recursive example programming language
    PL-{GOTO} from Brainerd and Landweber's *[[Theory of Computation]]* for some time.
    And for some reason I will never be able to explain, I had the craving to implement a compiler
    which could produce .NET executables by generating MSIL assembly language.  And putting
    those two together — well, that struck me as a respectably absurd match, so that's what I did.
    The compiler is written in Haskell and uses Parsec for parsing PL-{GOTO} programs; I tried
    to keep the grammar true to what is presented in the book, not refactoring it to be LL(1), and
    keeping the `←` symbol for assignment.

  genre: Esolang
  paradigms:
  - String-rewriting

  computational-class: believed Turing-complete
  esowiki: Thue
  authors:
  - John Colagioia
  description: |
    The Thue programming language was invented by
    John Colagioia in early 2000.  It is named after the computational
    regimen it is based on — a pure string-rewriting process called a
    _semi-Thue grammar_, which is named for (and possibly created
    by) the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue (pronounced "TOO-ay").
    
    Thue represents one of the simplest possible ways
    to construe constraint-based programming.  It is to the constraint-based
    paradigm what languages like OISC are to the imperative paradigm;
    in other words, it's a tar pit.

  commentary: |
    Since I've been maintaining a distribution of this language for a while, and
    not otherwise involved with it, I decided I should finally implement it.
    After knocking my head against the spec and reference implementation
    for a few hours (over the course of months, or has it been years?), I finally
    did implement it.

    Seeing that there was no *non*-pathological implementation of Alex Smith's
    beautiful [[Underload]] language in C, I undertook that project one evening.
    (In the company of a bottle of really fine wine.  Why, it cost almost twelve dollars.)
    The result is one of the most pedantic and boring Underload interpreters known to
    man.  Perhaps the most interesting property of it is its name, `stringie`, which was
    an accident.
