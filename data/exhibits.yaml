Esolangs Exhibit:
  type: Exhibit
  description: |
    An exhibit of many [[Esolang|esoteric programming languages]] in action,
    with which you can experiment.  By selecting sample
    programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of how the
    esolang computes stuff; by composing your own programs, you can gain an even
    better appreciation.

    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is a video game where you guide a soap bubble
    through a multi-screen maze.  Based on the cheesy original written in
    [[Commodore BASIC 2.0|BASIC]] in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly]], crunched to fit
    into 2K, and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]], where
    it got first place in its class.

    run on programs in a Java™ applet.
    
    Currently, yoob can interpret 21 languages: [[1L_AOI]], [[1L_a]], [[2-ill]], [[2L]],
    [[Ale]], [[BackFlip]], [[Befunge-93]], [[Black]], [[brainfuck]], [[Circute]], [[Etcha]],
    [[Gemooy]], [[LNUSP]], [[noit o' mnain worb]], [[PATH]], [[Qdeql]], [[Sceql]],
    [[SMETANA]], [[SNUSP]], [[Wunnel]], and [[Ypsilax]].  This exhibit shows yoob in

  description: |
    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.
