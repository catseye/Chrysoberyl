    <p>At Cat's Eye Technologies, we have long beheld a few programming languages as exceptionally worth
    persual and appreciation, despite the fact that they have no implementations, are not under active development,
    and were not designed by Chris Pressey (or at least, you can't prove it.)  We have, until recently, hosted these
    in our <a href="../../projects/">projects space</a>.  However, because of the criteria listed in the first sentence,
    we decided that these aren't really "projects" in any good sense, and we resolved to establish a distinguished
    display case for these beauties on this website.</p>
    
    An exhibit of a handful of programming languages that we hold to be
    exceptionally worth persual and appreciation.  These exhibits are in the
    form of documentation on these languages – articles, or specifications, or
    whatever passes for a specification for the language, as the case may be.

  c64gallery: |
    An exhibit of programs written for the Commodore 64.  This gallery is
    interactive, powered by the JaC64 Java™ applet, which allows you to run
    Commodore 64 programs in your web browser.  This gallery is primarily,
    but not exclusively, intended to present C64 games which have been developed
    by Cat's Eye Technologies.
  esolangsgallery: |
    An exhibit of many <a href="../about/esolang.html">esoteric programming languages</a> in action.
    This gallery is interactive, powered mostly by the yoob Java applet, which currently implements interpreters
    for 21 esolangs, and allows programs for them to be selected or composed, run, and observed while running.
    
    This gallery contains interactive implementations of [[Esolang|esoteric programming languages]]
    with which you can experiment.  By selecting sample programs and watching them run, you can gain an appreciation of
    how the esolang computes stuff; by composing your own programs, you can gain an even better appreciation.  Most of these
    esolang implementations are in the form of Java™ applets.


Bubble Escape 2K exhibit:
  type: Exhibit
  exhibit-type: game
  exhibit-link: http://catseye.tc/gallery/c64/bubble-escape-2k/
  interactive: true
  description: |
    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] playable online in the [[JaC64]] [[Commodore 64]]
    emulator Java applet.
    
    A video game where you guide a bubble through a multi-screen maze.
    Based on the cheesy original written in BASIC in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in 6502 assembly, crunched to fit into 2K, and submitted
    to the Mini Game Competition 2009, where it got first place in its
    class.

21 Esolangs in yoob:
  type: Exhibit
  exhibit-type: esolang
  exhibit-link: http://catseye.tc/gallery/esolang/yoob/
  interactive: true
  description: |
    [[yoob]] is a public-domain framework for implementing esoteric programming languages, and allowing them to be interactively
    run on programs in a Java™ applet.
    
    Currently, yoob can interpret 21 languages: [[1L_AOI]], [[1L_a]], [[2-ill]], [[2L]],
    [[Ale]], [[BackFlip]], [[Befunge-93]], [[Black]], [[brainfuck]], [[Circute]], [[Etcha]],
    [[Gemooy]], [[LNUSP]], [[noit o' mnain worb]], [[PATH]], [[Qdeql]], [[Sceql]],
    [[SMETANA]], [[SNUSP]], [[Wunnel]], and [[Ypsilax]].  This exhibit shows yoob in
    action, and lets you play with all these esolangs online.

JWhothm exhibit:
  type: Exhibit
  exhibit-type: esolang
  exhibit-link: http://catseye.tc/gallery/esolang/jwhothm/
  interactive: true
  description: |
    Whothm is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.

  # "and some acm dudes"
  description: |
    Plankalkül was probably the very first attempt at a formalized notation for
    computer programs, and is considered by many to be the first programming language.
    This article describing the language, transliterated to HTML
    from scans provided by the Retrocomputing Museum, originally appeared in
    Communications of the ACM, July 1972, Volume 15, Number 7.
