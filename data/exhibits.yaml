    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is a video game where you guide a soap bubble
    through a multi-screen maze.  Based on the cheesy original written in
    [[Commodore BASIC 2.0|BASIC]] in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly]], crunched to fit
    into 2K, and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]], where
    it got first place in its class.
    
    You can play it online in this applet running [[JaC64]].
    Use your arrow keys to guide the bubble through the maze.  Avoid the
    hazards and find the five keys to unlock the exit.
  commentary: |
    If this game doesn't seem too impressive to you, try to remember, it's
    only two kilobytes of code!  These days you can't even sneeze in less
    than a megabyte.

    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.
