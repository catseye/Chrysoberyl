  medium: Java applet
  summary: |
    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is an [[Mini Game Compo 2009|award-winning]]
    video game where you guide a soap bubble through a multi-screen maze.
    You can play it online in this applet running [[JaC64]].
    Use your arrow keys to guide the bubble through the maze.  Avoid the
    hazards and find the five keys to unlock the exit.

    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is an video game where you guide a soap bubble
    through a multi-screen maze.  Based on the cheesy original written in
    [[Commodore BASIC 2.0|BASIC]] in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly]], crunched to fit
    into 2K, and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]], where
    it got first place in its class.
  commentary: |
    If this game doesn't seem too impressive to you, try to remember, it's
    only two kilobytes of code!  These days you can't even sneeze in less
    than a megabyte.

    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is

### Digital Art ###

'A Non-Random Walk (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  summary: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.
  description: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
    
    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* × 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

'Chzrxl (HTML5)':

  description: |
    "Chzrxl, the Living Inkblot."  Or is it a sort of self-attracting
    lava lamp?
    
    Regardless, the original idea was this: each ball travels on a
    sine-wave path (kind of like a spring) between a randomly-chosen
    pair of two other balls.
    
    It was soon discovered that if all balls are free to move like this,
    they all quickly collapse to a single point.  Thus, some number of
    balls are held fixed (5% by default).  The result is a slightly
    organic-seeming emergent motion.
    
    The percentage of balls held fixed can be changed by the slider, and
    the "Restart" button can be used to scatter the balls and restart their
    movements.  You can try out different values and see which one you like
    the best.

'Cyclobots (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  summary: |
    An in-browser implementation of [[Cyclobots]].
  description: |
    An in-browser implementation of [[Cyclobots]].
    Each "cyclobot" tries to follow exactly one other cyclobot, adjusting
    its heading to point towards the cyclobot it is following.
    No cylobot is followed by more than one cyclobot.
    When a revolution occurs, every cyclobot picks a new cyclobot to follow
    at random.
    In case the cyclobots leave the viewable area of the playfield,
    dragging on the playfield will scroll it.

'Fibonacci Spiral (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: false
  animated: true

  summary: |
    A spiral made up of semicircles with proportions in the Fibonacci sequence.
  description: |
    A spiral made up of semicircles with proportions in the Fibonacci sequence.
    The semicircles alternate being on the left and the right.  The first
    two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are `1, 1` and these make up the unit
    circle in the center of the spiral.
    
    The animation is simply a zooming out and back in on the spiral.

'Fingerspelling (HTML5)':

    A simple interactive HTML5 entertainment, intended to be experienced
    on a touchscreen device.
  instructions: |
    If you have a touchscreen, prod the lavender area of the screen with your
    finger.  If you don't have a touchscreen, you may simulate this action
    with your mouse pointer.
  commentary: |    
    This is most certainly a gewgaw.  It should provide you about
    20 seconds of entertainment, give or take.

'Hirsute Miasma (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: false
  animated: true

    A somewhat eerie computed animation.
  instructions: |
    The animation will eventually cycle if you're patient (although it won't
    of course cycle exactly, as there is a random element.)  You may enable
    the "terminal" option to prevent this cycling.

'Heronsis hermnonicii (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true

  instructions: |
    It is primarily meant to just be watched, but you may find it entertaining
    to try clicking on the entities.
  summary: |
    An animated "plate" depicting a proto-cohort of *Heronsis hermnonicii*.
  description: |
    An animated "plate" depicting a proto-cohort of *Heronsis hermnonicii*.
  commentary: |
    *Warning: the following may contain tedious and/or glib
    background and/or analysis.*
    
    Casting a negative space of knowledge.  Calling itself a "plate" frames
    it as a work of learning, like some kind of 19th-century anthropology text.
    Yet it only raises questions — what are these entities?  what kind of
    world do they inhabit?  what are they protecting?  who is Clarkson?
    — without providing answers, leaving it up to the observer to either
    imagine their own answers, or decide that answers to these questions
    are not necessary.
    
    Plus it's fun to click on the red balls.

'Multicolouralism (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  summary: |
    Animated op art: an interactive bleeding of colours.
  description: |
    Each frame, the colour of each cell is chosen randomly from the set
    {cyan, magenta, yellow, white}.  The probability of each of the
    colours is determined by the distance from the cell to each corner
    of the square, raised to a power (the "field strength") which can
    be selected by the slider.
    
    Do you see false colours at the "borders" between the "fields"?
    You certainly *can*, but how much you see them seems to depend on
    several factors (your computer, monitor, lighting, persistence
    of vision, focus and peripheral vision...)

  commentary: |
    A real eye-tickler.  This was one of the first bits of `<canvas>` code I
    ever wrote; I essentially wrote it by accident — it wasn't quite what I
    meant, but I liked it, and kept it.  For me, in Firefox, it starts getting
    interesting around 100 iterations, and starts stopping being interesting
    around 1550.  In Chromium, you can still see some activity at about 2000
    iterations, but it's very faint thereafter.
