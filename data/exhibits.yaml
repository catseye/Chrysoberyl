'Bubble Escape (JaC64)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Computer Games Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: Java applet
  description: |
    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is a video game where you guide a soap bubble
    through a multi-screen maze.  Based on the cheesy original written in
    [[Commodore BASIC 2.0|BASIC]] in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly]], crunched to fit
    into 2K, and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]], where
    it got first place in its class.
    
    You can play it online in this applet running [[JaC64]].
    Use your arrow keys to guide the bubble through the maze.  Avoid the
    hazards and find the five keys to unlock the exit.
  commentary: |
    If this game doesn't seem too impressive to you, try to remember, it's
    only two kilobytes of code!  These days you can't even sneeze in less
    than a megabyte.

### Esolangs ###

'yoob (Applet)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Esolangs Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: Java applet
  description: |
    [[yoob]] is a public-domain framework for implementing esoteric programming languages, and allowing them to be interactively
    run on programs in a Java™ applet.
    
    Currently, yoob can interpret 21 languages: [[1L_AOI]], [[1L_a]], [[2-ill]], [[2L]],
    [[Ale]], [[BackFlip]], [[Befunge-93]], [[Black]], [[brainfuck]], [[Circute]], [[Etcha]],
    [[Gemooy]], [[LNUSP]], [[noit o' mnain worb]], [[PATH]], [[Qdeql]], [[Sceql]],
    [[SMETANA]], [[SNUSP]], [[Wunnel]], and [[Ypsilax]].  This exhibit shows yoob in
    action, and lets you play with all these esolangs online.

'Whothm (Applet)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Esolangs Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: false
  medium: Java applet
  description: |
    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.

### Digital Art ###

'A Non-Random Walk (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  instructions: |
    Pick a card, any card.  Half are red, half are black.  Each time a
    card is picked, the wheel moves.  The distance moved is always
    half the distance from the wheel to the origin (the black dot), *but*
    the direction depends on the colour of the card: red moves left,
    black moves right.
  description: |
    This is an animated version of the "non-random walk" on p. 72 of
    [[Mathematical Circus]] by [[Martin Gardner]].
    
    Because the cards are shuffled, the picks are random, and you might think
    that it's not possible to tell where the wheel will stop, once all cards
    have been turned over.  However, that's not the case.  The wheel always
    stops at a distance *a* - *a* × 0.75^*n* from the origin, where *a* is
    the starting position of the wheel, and *n* is the number of red (or black)
    cards.

'Cyclobots (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    An in-browser implementation of [[Cyclobots]].
    Each "cyclobot" tries to follow exactly one other cyclobot, adjusting
    its heading to point towards the cyclobot it is following.
    No cylobot is followed by more than one cyclobot.
    When a revolution occurs, every cyclobot picks a new cyclobot to follow
    at random.
    In case the cyclobots leave the viewable area of the playfield,
    dragging on the playfield will scroll it.
    
'Fingerspelling (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    A simple interactive HTML5 entertainment, intended to be experienced
    on a touchscreen device.
  instructions: |
    If you have a touchscreen, prod the lavender area of the screen with your
    finger.  If you don't have a touchscreen, you may simulate this action
    with your mouse pointer.
  commentary: |    
    This is most certainly a gewgaw.  It should provide you about
    20 seconds of entertainment, give or take.

'Hirsute Miasma (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: false
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    A somewhat eerie computed animation.
  instructions: |
    The animation will eventually cycle if you're patient (although it won't
    of course cycle exactly, as there is a random element.)  You may enable
    the "terminal" option to prevent this cycling.

'Heronsis hermnonicii (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  instructions: |
    It is primarily meant to just be watched, but you may find it entertaining
    to try clicking on the entities.
  description: |
    An animated "plate" depicting a proto-cohort of *Heronsis hermnonicii*.
  commentary: |
    *Warning: the following may contain tedious and/or glib
    background and/or analysis.*
    
    Casting a negative space of knowledge.  Calling itself a "plate" frames
    it as a work of learning, like some kind of 19th-century anthropology text.
    Yet it only raises questions — what are these entities?  what kind of
    world do they inhabit?  what are they protecting?  who is Clarkson?
    — without providing answers, leaving it up to the observer to either
    imagine their own answers, or decide that answers to these questions
    are not necessary.
    
    Plus it's fun to click on the red balls.

'Hypongtrochoid (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    "Hypongtrochoid" is a portmanteau of
    [hypotrochoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid)
    (as popularized by [Spirograph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph))
    and [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
    (as popularized by, well, Pong.)  Each box moves with a constant velocity
    relative to the box it is contained in, and bounces around inside it in a
    simple fashion.  Yet the path traced out by the innermost box is not very
    simple at all.

  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: false

  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    An animated impressionistic depiction of the prairies.
  commentary: |
    I composed this while still in Winnipeg and still
    learning about the capabilities of `<canvas>` — something about the
    wind and the wheat...  The background is a public-domain drawing
    of a grain elevator taken from Wikimedia.

'Progression (HTML5)':

  interactive: false

  description: |
    Animated op-art exhibiting a [moiré](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) effect.
  commentary: |
    A real eye-tickler.  This was one of the first bits of `<canvas>` code I
    ever wrote; I essentially wrote it by accident — it wasn't quite what I
    meant, but I liked it, and kept it.  For me, in Firefox, it starts getting
    interesting around 100 iterations, and starts stopping being interesting
    around 1550.  In Chromium, you can still see some activity at about 2000
    iterations, but it's very faint thereafter.

'The Frame (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  instructions: | 
    Note 1. Green things can be dragged.  
    Note 2. Due to technical limitations, things cannot be dragged off
    of the computer screen.
  description: |
    An interactive exploration of the concept of The Frame in art,
    based on **words** and **'do** by [[Frank Zappa]].
  commentary: |
    This piece was conceived and begun in late summer or early autumn of 2012,
    in Winnipeg, and finished up and released from Cornwall in spring of
    2013.
