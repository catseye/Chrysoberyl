'Bubble Escape (JaC64)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Computer Games Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: Java applet
  description: |
    [[Bubble Escape 2K]] is a video game where you guide a soap bubble
    through a multi-screen maze.  Based on the cheesy original written in
    [[Commodore BASIC 2.0|BASIC]] in the 80's, this version
    was rewritten in [[Ophis Assembler|6502 assembly]], crunched to fit
    into 2K, and submitted to the [[Mini Game Compo 2009]], where
    it got first place in its class.
    
    You can play it online in this applet running [[JaC64]].
    Use your arrow keys to guide the bubble through the maze.  Avoid the
    hazards and find the five keys to unlock the exit.
  commentary: |
    If this game doesn't seem too impressive to you, try to remember, it's
    only two kilobytes of code!  These days you can't even sneeze in less
    than a megabyte.

  description: |
    [[yoob]] is a public-domain framework for implementing esoteric programming languages, and allowing them to be interactively
    run on programs in a Java™ applet.
    
    Currently, yoob can interpret 21 languages: [[1L_AOI]], [[1L_a]], [[2-ill]], [[2L]],
    [[Ale]], [[BackFlip]], [[Befunge-93]], [[Black]], [[brainfuck]], [[Circute]], [[Etcha]],
    [[Gemooy]], [[LNUSP]], [[noit o' mnain worb]], [[PATH]], [[Qdeql]], [[Sceql]],
    [[SMETANA]], [[SNUSP]], [[Wunnel]], and [[Ypsilax]].  This exhibit shows yoob in
    action, and lets you play with all these esolangs online.

'Whothm (Applet)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Esolangs Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: false
  medium: Java applet
  description: |
    [[Whothm]] is a simple language for describing infinite two-colour bitmapped graphics.  This exhibit contains a Java applet
    which implements Whothm, and lets you interactive try out Whothm programs online.  The implementation is only
    an approximation; only a small portion of the infinite drawing (a couple of hundred iterations) is rendered.  The rest is
    left up to your imagination.

### Digital Art ###

'Cyclobots (HTML5)':
  type: Online Installation
  exhibit: Digital Art Exhibit
  interactive: true
  animated: true
  medium: HTML5
  description: |
    An in-browser implementation of [[Cyclobots]].
    Each "cyclobot" tries to follow exactly one other cyclobot, adjusting
    its heading to point towards the cyclobot it is following.
    No cylobot is followed by more than one cyclobot.
    When a revolution occurs, every cyclobot picks a new cyclobot to follow
    at random.
    In case the cyclobots leave the viewable area of the playfield,
    dragging on the playfield will scroll it.

    An animated impressionistic depiction of the prairies.
  commentary: |
    I composed this while still in Winnipeg and still
    learning about the capabilities of `<canvas>` — something about the
    wind and the wheat...  The background is a public-domain drawing
    of a grain elevator taken from Wikimedia.

    Animated op-art exhibiting a [moiré](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern) effect.
  commentary: |
    A real eye-tickler.  This was one of the first bits of `<canvas>` code I
    ever wrote; I essentially wrote it by accident — it wasn't quite what I
    meant, but I liked it, and kept it.  For me, in Firefox, it starts getting
    interesting around 100 iterations, and starts stopping being interesting
    around 1550.  In Chromium, you can still see some activity at about 2000
    iterations, but it's very faint thereafter.
