    _Chrysoberyl_ is an attempt to catalogue and curate all things
    produced by, and related to, [[Cat's Eye Technologies]],
    largely revolving around its output of
    [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|programming languages]],
    [[Tool|tools]], [[Platform|platforms]], [[Library|libraries]],
    [[Game|games]], and [[What is this I don't even|music]].
    It is sort of a cross between a wiki and a semantic web and
    _[[The Devil's Dictionary]]_.
