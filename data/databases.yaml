    _Chrysoberyl_ is an attempt to catalogue and curate all things
    produced by, and related to, [[Cat's Eye Technologies]],
    largely revolving around its output of
    [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|programming languages]],
    [[Tool|tools]], [[Platform|platforms]], [[Library|libraries]],
    [[Game|games]], and [[What is this I don't even|music]].
    It is sort of a cross between a wiki and a semantic web and
    _[[The Devil's Dictionary]]_.
    
    > When removing Kosuth's _One and Three Chairs_ from exhibition,
    > the major museum that owned the piece was reputedly uncertain
    > as to where it should be stored, there being no department of
    > "Conceptual art", and hence no specific storage area.  Eventually
    > it was stored according to the logic of the museum: the chair
    > was stored in the design department, the photograph of the chair
    > in the photography department and the photocopy of the dictionary
    > stored in the library!  So in effect they could only store the
    > piece by destroying it.
