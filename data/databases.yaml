  description: |
    _Chrysoberyl_ is an attempt to catalogue and curate all things
    produced by, and related to, [[Cat's Eye Technologies]],
    largely revolving around [[Chris Pressey]]'s
    [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|programming languages]],
    [[Tools by Chris Pressey|tools]],
    [[Games by Chris Pressey|games]], and [[Music by Chris Pressey|music]].
    It is sort of a cross between a wiki and a semantic web and
    _[[The Devil's Dictionary]]_.
  commentary: |
    The grammar and diction of Chrysoberyl's auto-generated
    descriptions might not be so hot at times; please cut it some slack in this regard.
