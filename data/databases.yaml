  description: |
    _Chrysoberyl_ is an attempt to catalogue and curate all things
    produced by, and related to, [[Cat's Eye Technologies]],
    largely revolving around its output of
    [[Chris Pressey's Lingography|programming languages]],
    [[Tool|tools]], [[Platform|platforms]], [[Library|libraries]],
    [[Game|games]], and [[What is this I don't even|music]].
    It is sort of a cross between a wiki and a semantic web and
    _[[The Devil's Dictionary]]_.

The Dossier:

  description: |
    While [[Chrysoberyl]] is an attempt to catalogue and curate
    things related directly to [[Cat's Eye Technologies]],
    _The Dossier_ was created to curate things only indirectly
    related.  It arose after an undesirable amount of stuff that
    was only indirectly related to Cat's Eye Technologies found
    its way into Chrysoberyl.
    
    The Dossier is also oriented towards long-form, opinion-based
    writing, distinct from Chrysoberyl's short-and-unbiased-blurb
    approach.
