The Biftek Shuffle:
  type: Musical Composition
  genre: Shuffle
  inception-date: ca 1987
  composed-on: Commodore 64
  using-software: SID Editor
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  commentary: |
    Apparently, when I was young, I was obsessed with
    (a) the 12-bar blues progression,
    (b) very small pitch ranges over the span of a melody or bass line
    (sometimes only three or four semitones,) and (c)
    repeating the same 4-bar melody ad naseum, with slightly different instrumentation
    each time (well, this is easy to do on a computer, right?)


Two Molecules of a Chip Box in Cosmic Relationship to a Yak:
  type: Musical Composition
  genre: Experimental music
  inception-date: ca 1987
  composed-on: Commodore 64
  using-software: SID Editor
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  commentary: |
    Pure experimentational weirdness with the C64's SID chip.
    The phrase "Chip Box" refers to the packaging for Old Dutch potato chips
    (a cardboard box, similar to a cereal box, which contains two plastic bags of chips.)
    The yak may or may not have been a nod to [[Jeff Minter]]; I don't recall.

    "Anagnoresis" is either an alternate spelling for, or a typo for,
    "Anagnorisis", which means the moment some profound realization
    is suddenly made.  The second snare beat in each measure is on the
    and-of-four instead of on four.

    A funky little tune with a somewhat strange musical structure -- it kind of goes
    all over the place, without building up to anything... kind of a A-A'-A-B-C-D form.
    Yet it doesn't feel like a medley, it feels fairly coherent (at least to me.)

    I've been told this would make a good background music for a [[Platformer]],
    although I'm not sure I agree.  I do like the signature chord at the start, though;
    the dissonance is entirely intentional, and it "works", but only because it's soon
    resolved.  Ends with a percussion solo, as does [[Go(Figure)]].

    Very, very short.  Intended to be preceded by [[A Moment in the Sun]]
