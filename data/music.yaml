The Biftek Shuffle:
  type: Musical Composition
  genre: Shuffle
  inception-date: ca 1987
  authors:
  - Chris Pressey
  commentary: |
    Apparently, when I was young, I was obsessed with
    (a) the 12-bar blues progression,
    (b) very small pitch ranges over the span of a melody or bass line
    (sometimes only three or four semitones,) and (c)
    repeating the same 4-bar melody ad naseum, with slightly different instrumentation
    each time (well, this is easy to do on a computer, right?)

  authors:

    (a cardboard box, similar to a cereal box, which contains two plastic bags of chips.)
