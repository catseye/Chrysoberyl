  commentary: |
    Apparently, when I was young, I was obsessed with
    (a) the 12-bar blues progression,
    (b) very small pitch ranges over the span of a melody or bass line
    (sometimes only three or four semitones,) and (c)
    repeating the same 4-bar melody ad naseum, with slightly different instrumentation
    each time (well, this is easy to do on a computer, right?)

    Pure experimentational weirdness with the C64's SID chip.
    The phrase "Chip Box" refers to the packaging for Old Dutch potato chips
    (a cardboard box, similar to a cereal box, which contains two plastic bags of chips.)
    The yak may or may not have been a nod to [[Jeff Minter]]; I don't recall.

    My only foray into reggae.  A happy sort of tune;
    it was originally supposed to be followed by [[Back to the Rain]]
    in some kind of putative playlist...

    Very, very short.  Intended to be preceded by [[A Moment in the Sun]]
    and serves more as an outro for that tune.  Or, maybe it could be used as the
    "oops you lost a life" music in a video game, that sort of thing.

    The title is meaningless; it's some kind
    of simple rustic air with a sitar duet jammed into the bridge.
    But it's another one of my favourites, because I like that sort of thing.

    I had three tunes that didn't stand on their own.  They don't go together
    either, so I put them together.  I've been told it's reminiscent of
    [[Frank Zappa]], but frankly I don't know if I've ever been able to make
    it through an entire Zappa song, so I couldn't say, myself.

    Here's what this icky techno piece tries to evoke: having a terrible
    hangover on the brightest morning of the summer while strolling
    through a garden that was planted by someone with a green
    thumb — it's very lush and in full bloom — but a very poor sense of
    how to lay out a garden.
