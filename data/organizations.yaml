"Cat's Eye Technologies":
  type: Organization
  description: |
    Cat's Eye Technologies is an independent esoteric programming language
    ([[Esolang]]) concern run by [[Chris Pressey]].
    
    It was established in 1995 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, originally
    as a custom software development and consulting outfit, serving several
    local clients.
    
    As the years passed and Chris moved around the world and became more
    and more involved in programming language issues, Cat's Eye
    Technologies became less and less of a software consulting firm and
    more and more of a... a what?  Whatever the hell it is now.
    
    A sponsoring organization for experimental programming language
    development.
    
    An aegis for the curation, and appreciation, of programming languages
    as art.  Especially weird ones.
    
    An excuse to refer to ourselves with a plural pronoun.
    
    We'd call it a brand, but we'd feel awfully dirty afterwards.
    
    We believe that, in an environment of rapidly changing requirements,
    *maintainability of source code* has the greatest effect on software
    quality, and that choice of [[Programming Language]]  profoundly
    affects maintainability.
    
    That is our official excuse for being interested in experimental
    programming languages.  The real reason is perhaps more frivolous.
   
    We also believe that [[Open-source]]
    software has an important civic and didactic role in modern society. For
    this reason, many of our software projects have been placed under
    permissive and [OSI Certified](http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php)
    licenses such as the [[BSD]] license, and made available for public
    download from the Internet.


# thass right, catseye.tc is just a concept now.  and what a concept!

    `catseye.tc` is [[Cat's Eye Technologies]]' website:
    [http://catseye.tc/](http://catseye.tc/).
    
    It was, until recently, the official distribution channel of Cat's Eye
    Technologies' public offerings — mostly software distributions, but also some
    electronics projects, unsolicited opinions, and other miscellany.  And in fact, it
    will continue to be canonical, in many respects; but many software
    services, such as public and distributed version-control repositories,
    and issue tracking, are now handled offsite, at Cat's Eye Technologies'
    accounts on 
    [Github](https://github.com/catseye/) and
    [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/catseye/).
    
    In years past, the Cat's Eye Technologies web site was hosted on
    various different domains.  From most recently to least recently, they
    were:
    
    *   `catseye.tc`
    *   `catseye.webhop.net`
    *   `catseye.mine.nu:8080`
    *   `www.catseye.mb.ca`
    *   `www.cats-eye.com`
    *   and way back in the mists of time, `www.pangea.ca/cet/`.
    
    This frequent relocation of our web address was done specifically to
    please [[Phantom Hoover]].
        
    `catseye.tc` has turned out to be more-or-less permanent.  Feel free to
    make links to this site using URLs that begin with
    `http://catseye.tc/`. The `www` prefix is not required.
        
    Our aim in making this website is that it both conforms to W3C
    standards and provides a reasonable user experience. Given the
    sheer variation that exists between browsers, this is not always easy.
        
    We use [[CSS]] for layout of these pages; we no longer use tables, or
    anything resembling tables (like `display: table-cell`), for layout.
    
    We do use [[Javascript]] on the pages on this site, but we try to do
    so judiciously.
    
    Our webpages strive to
    conform to the W3C Recommendation [XHTML 1.0
    Strict](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/).
    Most of the webpages on this site are generated from underlying XML
    documents using XSLT stylesheets, even the pages which do not have any
    significant data structure to them. This is not just for buzzword
    conformance — it helps in catching XHTML errors early, as well as
    providing formatting and layout that is consistent across the site while
    being easy to change.
    
    However, everything in the above paragraph is likely going to change
    in the near future.  Our working plan is to generate the website as
    HTML 5 from a loosely-structured database of things we've done and
    seen, stored in YAML files, called [[Chrysoberyl]].  Stay tuned.
