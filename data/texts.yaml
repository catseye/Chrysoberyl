Nif:
  type: Text
  development-stage: mature
  no-specification: true
  inception-date: Nov 2013
  summary: |
    *Nif* is a novel generated for NaNoGenMo 2013.  It is about a petulant child
    (possibly named Nif) who has just discovered palindromes.  It is one long
    palindrome.
  commentary: |
    *Nif* was inspired by, and draws heavily from, Nick Montfort's
    "The Utterance of the Petulant Child." In fact, it is pretty much an homage to
    "Utterance" which attempts to turn the petulance dial up to eleven, so to speak.
    Its creation was also sparked by a dim memory of the life ambition of one of
    the characters on the terrible 80's sitcom Head of the Class, which was:
    to write a novel that was one long palindrome.
