    *Doby Mick, or, the Excessively Spoonerized Whale*
    is a novel generated for [[NaNoGenMo 2014]].  A spoonerization algorithm
    was developed, which picks two words from each phrase of each
    sentence and swaps their initial consonant clusters.  This was run on
    Moby Dick, to produce this novel.

    is a novel generated for [[NaNoGenMo 2014]].  The minimum word count
    for a NaNoGenMo novel is 50,000 words, and the question occurred:
    if one wanted to make a novel with *exactly* that many words using
    just combinations and/or permutations, what combinations should one pick?

    It was based on the premise that, while sometimes automata do

    things that are worthy of automata, too.
