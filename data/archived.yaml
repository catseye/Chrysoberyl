    it calculates the amount of time between now and when the next is due
    to run, and sleeps exactly that long.

    those trees. The source trees are typically the working directories of
    local git or Mercurial clones, or they can be source distributions from tarballs.

  authors:

  description: |
    `transmat` is a network synchronization tool written in Python. It is not
    particularly remarkable, but since it has been used in hostile
    environments at points (e.g. unreliable dial-up connections, and
    [[Cygwin]] on Vista,) it does go to some lengths to be robust, to support
    lousy protocols (namely FTP), and to minimize transmission time during
    synchronization.
