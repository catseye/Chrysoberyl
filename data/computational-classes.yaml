Turing-complete:
  type: Computational Class
  description: |
    A system (generally speaking, a [[Programming Language|programming language]])
    is Turing-complete if it can do everything a Turing machine can do.
    
    If, in the [[Chrysoberyl]] database, a programming language is labelled
    as Turing-complete, it means that it has been demonstrated in a
    (reasonably) formal way â€” as opposed to it
    [[believed Turing-complete|being so uncontroversial that no one has bothered.]]

believed Turing-complete:
  type: Computational Class
  description: |
    Means that the author, or the general public, has reason to believe that
    the language is [[Turing-complete]], but no (reasonably) formal proof
    has been provided for the claim.
